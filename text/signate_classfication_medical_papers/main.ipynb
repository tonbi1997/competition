The neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of cognitive change are unclear  as there is little information on longitudinal brain changes. We are conducting a longitudinal neuroimaging study of nondemented older participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. This report focuses on age and sex differences in brain structure measured by magnetic resonance imaging during the first two annual evaluations. Cross-sectional results from 116 participants aged 59-85 years reveal significantly larger ventricular volumes and smaller gray and white matter volumes in older compared with younger participants and in men compared with women. Regional brain volumes show that the effects of age and sex are not uniform across brain regions. Age differences are greatest for the parietal region. Sex differences tend to be larger for frontal and temporal than parietal and occipital regions. Longitudinal analysis demonstrates an increase of 1526 mm(3) in ventricular volume over 1 year  but no detectable change in total or regional brain volumes. Definition of the pattern and rate of longitudinal brain changes will facilitate the detection of pathological brain changes  which may be predictors of dementia.</td>\n",

A total of 20 subjects diagnosed clinically as Alzheimer's dementia according to the NIA-AA criteria for AD were included in the study. The CSF biomarkers Aﾎｲ42  t-tau  and p-tau181 were assessed. The biomarker results were compared among mild and moderate to severe AD as defined in the NIA-AA work group guidelines. The results revealed that the amount of Aﾎｲ42 was very low in all the 20 samples (&lt;50pg/ml) collected from mild AD cases with CDR score of 1 (n=8)  and moderate to severe AD cases with CDR &gt;1 (n=12). t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 39.45ﾂｱ5.09pg/ml and 13.06ﾂｱ7.32pg/ml for CDR 1 group. t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 49.9ﾂｱ11.28pg/ml and 33.94ﾂｱ15.13pg/ml for moderate to severe cases. Analysis of the data revealed statistically significant differences in the p-tau/t-tau ratio and p-tau/Aﾎｲ ratio between CDR 1and CDR &gt;1 AD cases (p&lt;0.001) suggesting that p-tau/t-tau and p-tau/Aﾎｲ ratio are good indicators of severity of dementia with discriminative value in differentiating mild AD from moderate to severe AD.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic chronic-inflammatory bowel diseases, i.e. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are still unknown. This has no effect on diagnosis, yet does affect treatment of these diseases, which has thus remained symptomatic. Clinical features, laboratory findings, endoscopy in conjunction with histologic examination and radiologic studies are all of proven value in the diagnosis of these disorders. Microbiologic and, if indicated, serologic studies are employed to search for colitis caused by microorganisms. Other bowel disorders to be considered in differential diagnosis include ischemic, radiation and drug-induced forms of colitis, as well as diverticulitis. More recently introduced techniques for the detection of secondary intra-abdominal processes are CT-scan and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Ultrasound examination of the abdomen can be used to search for thickening of the bowel wall. Use of the rather complicated hydrocolon sonography is rarely necessary. Endo-sonography is an established method for exploration of the rectum and is particularly useful for the detection of abscesses. The role of this technique in the diagnosis of colon processes remains to be determined. Studies using radiolabeled leukocytes are of theoretical interest but not usually required in the routine work-up of such patients. The same is true of chemical analyses of the feces and testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Standard systemic treatment is based on the administration of salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine can be used in patients refractory to standard treatment. Metronidazole has been proven quite effective in patients with Crohn's disease of the colon, particularly in the perianal region. The role of the immunosuppressive agents methotrexate and cyclosporin is yet unclear. Eagerly awaited are the novel corticosteroids which produce no or only limited systemic effects. These agents give promise of long-term treatment without adverse effects. 5-lipoxygenase-inhibitors to reduce leukotrienes and monoclonal antibodies to block CD4+ T-lymphocytes also appear to be promising. Suppositories, enemas and drugs available in foamy form can be used for local treatment of proctitis and distal colitis. Standard agents for local application are again salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids. The novel corticosteroids which lack systemic activity appear particularly promising for these indications. Recently, various other compounds have been developed for rectal application. The most interesting among these agents appear to be lidocaine and short-chain fatty acids.</td>\n",

The neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of cognitive change are unclear  as there is little information on longitudinal brain changes. We are conducting a longitudinal neuroimaging study of nondemented older participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. This report focuses on age and sex differences in brain structure measured by magnetic resonance imaging during the first two annual evaluations. Cross-sectional results from 116 participants aged 59-85 years reveal significantly larger ventricular volumes and smaller gray and white matter volumes in older compared with younger participants and in men compared with women. Regional brain volumes show that the effects of age and sex are not uniform across brain regions. Age differences are greatest for the parietal region. Sex differences tend to be larger for frontal and temporal than parietal and occipital regions. Longitudinal analysis demonstrates an increase of 1526 mm(3) in ventricular volume over 1 year  but no detectable change in total or regional brain volumes. Definition of the pattern and rate of longitudinal brain changes will facilitate the detection of pathological brain changes  which may be predictors of dementia.   \n",

A total of 20 subjects diagnosed clinically as Alzheimer's dementia according to the NIA-AA criteria for AD were included in the study. The CSF biomarkers Aﾎｲ42  t-tau  and p-tau181 were assessed. The biomarker results were compared among mild and moderate to severe AD as defined in the NIA-AA work group guidelines. The results revealed that the amount of Aﾎｲ42 was very low in all the 20 samples (<50pg/ml) collected from mild AD cases with CDR score of 1 (n=8)  and moderate to severe AD cases with CDR >1 (n=12). t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 39.45ﾂｱ5.09pg/ml and 13.06ﾂｱ7.32pg/ml for CDR 1 group. t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 49.9ﾂｱ11.28pg/ml and 33.94ﾂｱ15.13pg/ml for moderate to severe cases. Analysis of the data revealed statistically significant differences in the p-tau/t-tau ratio and p-tau/Aﾎｲ ratio between CDR 1and CDR >1 AD cases (p<0.001) suggesting that p-tau/t-tau and p-tau/Aﾎｲ ratio are good indicators of severity of dementia with discriminative value in differentiating mild AD from moderate to severe AD.   \n",

Design: Case series. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Patients: Four patients. Interventions: Computed tomography  magnetic resonance imaging  positron emission tomography  biopsy  chemotherapy  and radiation therapy. Main Outcome Measures: Recognition of clinical syndrome and radiological features. Results: All patients had progressive hemiparesis  and 1 patient also had frontal lobe dementia. Imaging demonstrated progressive asymmetric signal abnormality with basal ganglia calcification and associated brainstem atrophy. Fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron emission tomography showed hypometabolism in contrast to malignant glioma. Conclusion: Germ cell tumor should be considered in patients with an indolently progressive neurological course  particularly if basal ganglia calcification is present with or without enhancement  asymmetric brain atrophy  or a mass. ©2009 American Medical Association.

       "3   The etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic chronic-inflammatory bowel diseases, i.e. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are still unknown. This has no effect on diagnosis, yet does affect treatment of these diseases, which has thus remained symptomatic. Clinical features, laboratory findings, endoscopy in conjunction with histologic examination and radiologic studies are all of proven value in the diagnosis of these disorders. Microbiologic and, if indicated, serologic studies are employed to search for colitis caused by microorganisms. Other bowel disorders to be considered in differential diagnosis include ischemic, radiation and drug-induced forms of colitis, as well as diverticulitis. More recently introduced techniques for the detection of secondary intra-abdominal processes are CT-scan and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Ultrasound examination of the abdomen can be used to search for thickening of the bowel wall. Use of the rather complicated hydrocolon sonography is rarely necessary. Endo-sonography is an established method for exploration of the rectum and is particularly useful for the detection of abscesses. The role of this technique in the diagnosis of colon processes remains to be determined. Studies using radiolabeled leukocytes are of theoretical interest but not usually required in the routine work-up of such patients. The same is true of chemical analyses of the feces and testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Standard systemic treatment is based on the administration of salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine can be used in patients refractory to standard treatment. Metronidazole has been proven quite effective in patients with Crohn's disease of the colon, particularly in the perianal region. The role of the immunosuppressive agents methotrexate and cyclosporin is yet unclear. Eagerly awaited are the novel corticosteroids which produce no or only limited systemic effects. These agents give promise of long-term treatment without adverse effects. 5-lipoxygenase-inhibitors to reduce leukotrienes and monoclonal antibodies to block CD4+ T-lymphocytes also appear to be promising. Suppositories, enemas and drugs available in foamy form can be used for local treatment of proctitis and distal colitis. Standard agents for local application are again salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids. The novel corticosteroids which lack systemic activity appear particularly promising for these indications. Recently, various other compounds have been developed for rectal application. The most interesting among these agents appear to be lidocaine and short-chain fatty acids.   \n",

The neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of cognitive change are unclear  as there is little information on longitudinal brain changes. We are conducting a longitudinal neuroimaging study of nondemented older participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. This report focuses on age and sex differences in brain structure measured by magnetic resonance imaging during the first two annual evaluations. Cross-sectional results from 116 participants aged 59-85 years reveal significantly larger ventricular volumes and smaller gray and white matter volumes in older compared with younger participants and in men compared with women. Regional brain volumes show that the effects of age and sex are not uniform across brain regions. Age differences are greatest for the parietal region. Sex differences tend to be larger for frontal and temporal than parietal and occipital regions. Longitudinal analysis demonstrates an increase of 1526 mm(3) in ventricular volume over 1 year  but no detectable change in total or regional brain volumes. Definition of the pattern and rate of longitudinal brain changes will facilitate the detection of pathological brain changes  which may be predictors of dementia.  \n",

A total of 20 subjects diagnosed clinically as Alzheimer's dementia according to the NIA-AA criteria for AD were included in the study. The CSF biomarkers Aﾎｲ42  t-tau  and p-tau181 were assessed. The biomarker results were compared among mild and moderate to severe AD as defined in the NIA-AA work group guidelines. The results revealed that the amount of Aﾎｲ42 was very low in all the 20 samples (<50pg/ml) collected from mild AD cases with CDR score of 1 (n=8)  and moderate to severe AD cases with CDR >1 (n=12). t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 39.45ﾂｱ5.09pg/ml and 13.06ﾂｱ7.32pg/ml for CDR 1 group. t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 49.9ﾂｱ11.28pg/ml and 33.94ﾂｱ15.13pg/ml for moderate to severe cases. Analysis of the data revealed statistically significant differences in the p-tau/t-tau ratio and p-tau/Aﾎｲ ratio between CDR 1and CDR >1 AD cases (p<0.001) suggesting that p-tau/t-tau and p-tau/Aﾎｲ ratio are good indicators of severity of dementia with discriminative value in differentiating mild AD from moderate to severe AD.  \n",

Design: Case series. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Patients: Four patients. Interventions: Computed tomography  magnetic resonance imaging  positron emission tomography  biopsy  chemotherapy  and radiation therapy. Main Outcome Measures: Recognition of clinical syndrome and radiological features. Results: All patients had progressive hemiparesis  and 1 patient also had frontal lobe dementia. Imaging demonstrated progressive asymmetric signal abnormality with basal ganglia calcification and associated brainstem atrophy. Fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron emission tomography showed hypometabolism in contrast to malignant glioma. Conclusion: Germ cell tumor should be considered in patients with an indolently progressive neurological course  particularly if basal ganglia calcification is present with or without enhancement  asymmetric brain atrophy  or a mass. ©2009 American Medical Association.

       "3   New developments in diagnosis and therapy of Crohn's disease and and ulcerative colitisThe etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic chronic-inflammatory bowel diseases, i.e. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are still unknown. This has no effect on diagnosis, yet does affect treatment of these diseases, which has thus remained symptomatic. Clinical features, laboratory findings, endoscopy in conjunction with histologic examination and radiologic studies are all of proven value in the diagnosis of these disorders. Microbiologic and, if indicated, serologic studies are employed to search for colitis caused by microorganisms. Other bowel disorders to be considered in differential diagnosis include ischemic, radiation and drug-induced forms of colitis, as well as diverticulitis. More recently introduced techniques for the detection of secondary intra-abdominal processes are CT-scan and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Ultrasound examination of the abdomen can be used to search for thickening of the bowel wall. Use of the rather complicated hydrocolon sonography is rarely necessary. Endo-sonography is an established method for exploration of the rectum and is particularly useful for the detection of abscesses. The role of this technique in the diagnosis of colon processes remains to be determined. Studies using radiolabeled leukocytes are of theoretical interest but not usually required in the routine work-up of such patients. The same is true of chemical analyses of the feces and testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Standard systemic treatment is based on the administration of salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine can be used in patients refractory to standard treatment. Metronidazole has been proven quite effective in patients with Crohn's disease of the colon, particularly in the perianal region. The role of the immunosuppressive agents methotrexate and cyclosporin is yet unclear. Eagerly awaited are the novel corticosteroids which produce no or only limited systemic effects. These agents give promise of long-term treatment without adverse effects. 5-lipoxygenase-inhibitors to reduce leukotrienes and monoclonal antibodies to block CD4+ T-lymphocytes also appear to be promising. Suppositories, enemas and drugs available in foamy form can be used for local treatment of proctitis and distal colitis. Standard agents for local application are again salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids. The novel corticosteroids which lack systemic activity appear particularly promising for these indications. Recently, various other compounds have been developed for rectal application. The most interesting among these agents appear to be lidocaine and short-chain fatty acids.  \n",

In microglia  PBR is expressed from the earliest stages of activation and appears to exert a pro-inflammatory function. This molecule is commonly up-regulated in inflammatory  degenerative  infective and ischaemic lesions of the central nervous system but it has never been reported in glioma-infiltrating microglia. We examined two anaplastic astrocytomas showing minimal contrast-enhancement and therefore little damage of the blood brain barrier to minimise the presence of blood borne macrophages within tumour tissue. The two lesions were studied in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) with the specific PBR ligand [11C](R)-PK11195 and the corresponding tumour tissue was investigated with an anti-PBR antibody. Glioma-infiltrating microglia were characterised for molecules involved in antigen presentation and cytotoxic activity. As comparison  PBR was investigated in three brains with multiple sclerosis (MS) and three with Parkinson's disease (PD). The expression profile of four anaplastic astrocytomas was also exploited and results were compared to the profile of eleven samples of normal temporal lobe and nine cases of PD. PET studies showed that [11C](R)-PK11195 binding was markedly lower in tumours than in the contralateral grey matter. Pathological investigation revealed that glioma-infiltrating microglia failed to express PBR and cytotoxic molecules although some cells still expressed antigen presenting molecules. PBR and cytotoxic molecules were highly represented in MS and PD. Evaluation of microarray datasets confirmed these differences. Our results demonstrated PBR suppression in glioma-infiltrating microglia and suggested that PBR may have a relevant role in modulating the anti-tumour inflammatory response in astrocytic tumours. ﾂｩ Springer Science+Business Media  LLC 2007\",\n",

       "  {'feature': \"The relationship between Abeta and memory in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Transgenic mice expressing mutant amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) have provided important new information about the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) histopathology. However  the molecular basis of memory loss in these mice is poorly understood. One of the major impediments has been the difficulty of distinguishing between age-dependent and age-independent behavioral changes. To address this issue we studied in parallel two lines of APP transgenic mice expressing comparable levels of mutant and wild-type human APP. This enabled us to identify age-independent behavioral deficits that were not specifically related to mutant APP expression. When mice with age-independent deficits were eliminated  we detected memory loss in transgenic mice expressing mutant APP (Tg2576 mice) starting at approximately 6 months  which coincided with the appearance of detergent-insoluble Abeta aggregates (Abeta(insol)). Genetically accelerating the formation of Abeta(insol) resulted in an earlier onset of memory decline. A facile interpretation of these results  namely that memory loss and Abeta(insol) were closely connected  was rejected when we extended our analysis to include older mice. No obvious correspondence between memory and Abeta(insol) was apparent in a combined group of old and young mice unless the mice were stratified by age  whereupon inverse correlations between memory and Abeta(insol) became evident. These results suggested that Abeta(insol) is a surrogate marker for small assemblies of Abeta that disrupt cognition and occur as intermediates during Abeta(insol) formation  and they are the first descriptive in vivo data supporting their role in impairing memory. These studies also provide a methodological framework within which to investigate these Abeta assemblies in vivo.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Causes and consequences of cerebral small vessel disease. The RUN DMC study: a prospective cohort study. Study rationale and protocol.BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a frequent finding on CT and MRI scans of elderly people and is related to vascular risk factors and cognitive and motor impairment  ultimately leading to dementia or parkinsonism in some. In general  the relations are weak  and not all subjects with SVD become demented or get parkinsonism. This might be explained by the diversity of underlying pathology of both white matter lesions (WML) and the normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Both cannot be properly appreciated with conventional MRI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides alternative information on microstructural white matter integrity. The association between SVD  its microstructural integrity  and incident dementia and parkinsonism has never been investigated. METHODS/DESIGN: The RUN DMC study is a prospective cohort study on the risk factors and cognitive and motor consequences of brain changes among 503 non-demented elderly  aged between 50-85 years  with cerebral SVD. First follow up is being prepared for July 2011. Participants alive will be included and invited to the research centre to undergo a structured questionnaire on demographics and vascular risk factors  and a cognitive  and motor  assessment  followed by a MRI protocol including conventional MRI  DTI and resting state fMRI. DISCUSSION: The follow up of the RUN DMC study has the potential to further unravel the causes and possibly better predict the consequences of changes in white matter integrity in elderly with SVD by using relatively new imaging techniques. When proven  these changes might function as a surrogate endpoint for cognitive and motor function in future therapeutic trials. Our data could furthermore provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive and motor disturbances in elderly with SVD. The execution and completion of the follow up of our study might ultimately unravel the role of SVD on the microstructural integrity of the white matter in the transition from \"normal\" aging to cognitive and motor decline and impairment and eventually to incident dementia and parkinsonism.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Risk factors for myocardial injury and death in patients with COVID-19: insights from a cohort study with chest computed tomographyAIMS: Whether pulmonary artery (PA) dimension and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, as assessed by chest computed tomography (CT), are associated with myocardial injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not known. The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors for myocardial injury and death and to investigate whether myocardial injury has an independent association with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a single-centre cohort study including consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 undergoing chest CT on admission. Myocardial injury was defined as high-sensitivity troponin I > 20 ng/L on admission. A total of 332 patients with a median follow-up of 12 days were included. There were 68 (20.5%) deaths; 123 (37%) patients had myocardial injury. PA diameter was higher in patients with myocardial injury compared with patients without myocardial injury [29.0 (25th-75th percentile, 27-32) mm vs. 27.7 (25-30) mm, <iP > < 0.001). PA diameter was independently associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury [adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.19, P = 0.01] and death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, P = 0.01]. Compared with patients without myocardial injury, patients with myocardial injury had a lower prevalence of a CAC score of zero (25% vs. 55%, <iP > < 0.001); however, the CAC score did not emerge as a predictor of myocardial injury by multivariable logistic regression. Myocardial injury was independently associated with an increased risk of death by multivariable Cox regression (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.27-3.96, P = 0.005). Older age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lower PaO<sub2>/FiO<sub2> ratio on admission were other independent predictors for both myocardial injury and death. CONCLUSIONS: An increased PA diameter, as assessed by chest CT, is an independent risk factor for myocardial injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Myocardial injury is independently associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of death. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: The present study identifies myocardial injury as a clinically relevant independent risk factor for death in the short term in a population of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 outside of China undergoing chest computed tomography for suspected pneumonia on admission. The study also provides novel insights into the risk factors for myocardial injury, showing that an increased pulmonary artery diameter, assessed by chest computed tomography, is an independent predictor of myocardial injury as well as of mortality, suggesting that pulmonary circulation dysfunction is a pivotal pathological event with cardiac implications in COVID-19.

We used parallel transport in diffeomorphisms under the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping framework to translate within-subject deformation of the hippocampal surface as represented in the MR images between the two time points in a global template coordinate system. We then performed hypothesis testing on the longitudinal variation of hippocampal shape in the global template. Both subjects with early DAT and converters showed greater rates of hippocampal deformation across time than nondemented controls within every subfield of the hippocampus. In a random field analysis  inward surface deformation across time occurred in a non-uniform manner across the hippocampal surface in subjects with early DAT relative to the nondemented controls. Also  compared to the controls  the lateral aspect of the left hippocampal tail showed inward surface deformation in the converters.

After controlling for age  FA and MD were exclusively related to perceptual speed. When further stratifying the sample into two age groups  the associations were reliable in the old-old (竕･ 78 years) only. This relationship between white matter microstructure and perceptual speed remained significant after excluding persons in a preclinical dementia phase.

Here we show that interaction of CypD with mitochondrial amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) potentiates mitochondrial  neuronal and synaptic stress. The CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition. Additionally  they have an increased calcium buffering capacity and generate fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore  the absence of CypD protects neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Notably  CypD deficiency substantially improves learning and memory and synaptic function in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation. Thus  the CypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore is directly linked to the cellular and synaptic perturbations observed in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-exempt, study was performed between February 3, 2020 and April 19, 2020 at a large academic medical center. During March 9-15 (intervention period), nonurgent outpatient service deferments began. Five-week periods pre- (baseline) and postintervention (COVID) were defined. Primary outcomes were radiology volume (reports per day) overall and in 11 subspecialty divisions. Linear regression assessed relationship between baseline vs. COVID volumes stratified by division. Secondary outcomes included changes in relative value units (RVUs), inpatient and outpatient volumes. RESULTS: There were 62,791 baseline reports vs. 23,369 during COVID; a 60% overall precipitous volume decrease (p < 0.001). Mean volume decrease pre- and during-COVID was significant (p < 0.001) amongst all individual divisions. Mean volume decrease differed amongst divisions: Interventional Radiology experienced least disruption (29% volume decrease), 7 divisions experienced 40%-60% decreases, and Musculoskeletal, Breast, and Cardiovascular imaging experienced >75% volume decrease.

Since the first person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Italy on February 21st, 2020, the number of people infected with SARS-COV-2 increased rapidly, mainly in northern Italian regions, including Piedmont. A strict lockdown was imposed on March 21st until May 4th when a gradual relaxation of the restrictions started. In this context, computational models and computer simulations are one of the available research tools that epidemiologists can exploit to understand the spread of the diseases and to evaluate social measures to counteract, mitigate or delay the spread of the epidemic. METHODS: This study presents an extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SEIRS) model accounting for population age structure. The infectious population is divided into three sub-groups: (i) undetected infected individuals, (ii) quarantined infected individuals and (iii) hospitalized infected individuals. Moreover, the strength of the government restriction measures and the related population response to these are explicitly represented in the model. RESULTS: The proposed model allows us to investigate different scenarios of the COVID-19 spread in Piedmont and the implementation of different infection-control measures and testing approaches. The results show that the implemented control measures have proven effective in containing the epidemic, mitigating the potential dangerous impact of a large proportion of undetected cases. We also forecast the optimal combination of individual-level measures and community surveillance to contain the new wave of COVID-19 spread after the re-opening work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Our model is an effective tool useful to investigate different scenarios and to inform policy makers about the potential impact of different control strategies.

Despite this clinical distinction  the neuropsychological and neuropathologic features of these conditions overlap. In addition to widespread distribution of Lewy bodies  both diseases have variable burdens of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To determine whether amyloid deposition  as assessed by PET imaging with the beta-amyloid-binding compound Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)  can distinguish DLB from PDD  and to assess whether regional patterns of amyloid deposition correlate with specific motor or cognitive features. METHODS: Eight DLB  7 PDD  11 Parkinson disease (PD)  15 AD  and 37 normal control (NC) subjects underwent PiB-PET imaging and neuropsychological assessment. Amyloid burden was quantified using the PiB distribution volume ratio. RESULTS: Cortical amyloid burden was higher in the DLB group than in the PDD group  comparable to the AD group. Amyloid deposition in the PDD group was low  comparable to the PD and NC groups. Relative to global cortical retention  occipital PiB retention was lower in the AD group than in the other groups. For the DLB  PDD  and PD groups  amyloid deposition in the parietal (lateral and precuneus)/posterior cingulate region was related to visuospatial impairment. Striatal PiB retention in the DLB and PDD groups was associated with less impaired motor function. CONCLUSIONS: Global cortical amyloid burden is high in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but low in Parkinson disease dementia. These data suggest that beta-amyloid may contribute selectively to the cognitive impairment of DLB and may contribute to the timing of dementia relative to the motor signs of parkinsonism.',\n",

In this study  the influence of the Swedish double-mutation form of APP (APPsw; KM670/671NL) on apoptosis regulation in PC12 cells was investigated. APPsw-transfected PC12 cells were compared with wild-type APP (APPwt)-expressing and vector-transfected PC12 cells with regard to their susceptibility to cell death induced by the reduction of trophic support or by additional treatment with staurosporine. Expression of APPsw markedly enhanced the level of apoptotic PC12 cells induced by serum reduction. A similar hypersensitivity of APPsw-expressing PC12 cells could be detected after differentiation with nerve growth factor under serum-reduced conditions. Likewise  the expression of APPsw rendered PC12 cells more vulnerable to staurosporine but only under serum-reduced conditions. This APPsw-effect disappeared in high serum-containing medium. Thus  expression of APPsw seems to enhance cellular sensitivity not in general but after the reduction of trophic factors probably by causing oxidative stress. This  in turn  may sensitize cells to secondary apoptotic stimuli. Moreover  the mutation-specific increase in vulnerability to cell death was only seen at the stage of apoptotic nuclei  but not using methods measuring cell death by determining metabolic activity or membrane integrity. Therefore  the expression of APPsw seems to affect specifically apoptotic cell death rather than overall cell death in vitro. Our study further emphasizes the pathogenic role of mutant APP and may provide new insights in the mechanisms underlying the massive neurodegeneration in brain from patients bearing the APPsw mutation.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': \"Predicting COVID-19 Pneumonia Severity on Chest X-ray With Deep LearningIntroduction The need to streamline patient management for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become more pressing than ever. Chest X-rays (CXRs) provide a non-invasive (potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we present a severity score prediction model for COVID-19 pneumonia for frontal chest X-ray images. Such a tool can gauge the severity of COVID-19 lung infections (and pneumonia in general) that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU. Methods Images from a public COVID-19 database were scored retrospectively by three blinded experts in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as the degree of opacity. A neural network model that was pre-trained on large (non-COVID-19) chest X-ray datasets is used to construct features for COVID-19 images which are predictive for our task. Results This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of the outputs from this pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean absolute error (MAE) and our lung opacity score (range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE. Conclusions These results indicate that our model's ability to gauge the severity of COVID-19 lung infections could be used for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU. To enable follow up work, we make our code, labels, and data available online. Copyright Â© 2020, Cohen et al.\",\n",

This has led to a greater presence of older people in the agenda setting of all the media. This article aims to analyse these discourses and representations related to older people as presented in the headlines of publications disseminated in 2national newspapers (ABC and El Pais) during the most critical phase of the pandemic in Spain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis was made of 501 headlines related to older people and the COVID-19 pandemic (380 from ABC, and 121 from El Pais) from the perspective of the Critical Discourse Studies (Van Dijk, 2003), as well as carrying out a content analysis. RESULTS: 71.4% of the headlines represented the Older adults were represented unfavourably in 71.4% of the headlines, with them being presented as a homogeneous group and associating them with deaths, deficiencies in residential care, or extreme vulnerability. The presence of certain potentially derogatory or improper terms (elderly, grandparents) was consistent with this negative representation. CONCLUSIONS: In light of these results, it is discussed to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic may reinforce an ageist narrative of the older people, based on frailty, decline, and dependency, which may justify discriminatory practices directed at this sector of the population.

METHODS: We carried out a follow-up study on 10 HD transplanted patients and 16 HD not-transplanted patients. All patients were evaluated with the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) whose change in motor  cognitive  behavioural and functional capacity total scores were considered as outcome measures. Grafted patients also received morphological and molecular neuroimaging. RESULTS: Patients were followed-up from disease onset for a total of 309.3 person-years (minimum 5.3  median 11.2 years  maximum 21.6 years). UHDRS scores have been available since 2004 (median time of 5.7 years since onset  minimum zero  maximum 17.2 years). Median post-transplantation follow-up was 4.3 years  minimum 2.8  maximum 5.1 years. Adjusted post-transplantation motor score deterioration rate was reduced compared to the pretransplantation period  and to that of not-transplanted patients by 0.9 unit/years (95% CI 0.2 to 1.6). Cognitive score deterioration was reduced of 2.7 unit/years (95% CI 0.1 to 5.3). For grafted patients the 2-year post-transplantation [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) showed striatal/cortical metabolic increase compared to the presurgical evaluation; 4-year post-transplantation PET values were slightly decreased  but remained higher than preoperatively. [(123)I]iodobenzamide single photon emission CT demonstrated an increase in striatal D2-receptor density during postgrafting follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Grafted patients experienced a milder clinical course with less pronounced motor/cognitive decline and associated brain metabolism improvement. Life-time follow-up may ultimately clarify whether transplantation permanently modifies the natural course of the disease  allowing longer sojourn time at less severe clinical stage  and improvement of overall survival.\",\n",

The current situation demands an effective therapeutic strategy to control the disease using drugs that are approved, or by inventing new ones. The present study examines the possible repurposing of existing anti-viral protease inhibitor drugs. For this, the structural features of the viral spike protein, the substrate for host cell protease and main protease of the available SARS CoV-2 isolates were established by comparing with related viruses for which antiviral drugs are effective. The results showed 97% sequence similarity among SARS and SARS-CoV-2 main protease and has same cleavage site positions and ACE2 receptor binding region as in the SARS-CoV spike protein. Though both are N-glycosylated, unlike SARS-CoV, human SARS-CoV-2 S-protein was O-glycosylated as well. Molecular docking studies were done to explore the role of FDA approved protease inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 replication. The results indicated that, Ritonavir has the highest potency to block SARS-CoV-2 main protease and human TMPRSS2, a host cell factor that aids viral infection. Other drugs such as Indinavir and Atazanavir also showed favourable binding with Cathepsin B/L that helped viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Further molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations confirmed the stability of protein-drug complexes. These results suggest that protease inhibitors particularly Ritonavir, either alone or in combination with other drugs such as Atazanavir, have the potential to treat COVID 19.

It also aimed at identifying the determinants of depression and anxiety. A total of 476 university students living in Bangladesh participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey. A standardized e-questionnaire was generated using the Google Form, and the link was shared through social media-Facebook. The information was analyzed in three consecutive levels, such as uni-variate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Students were experiencing heightened depression and anxiety. Around 15% of the students reportedly had moderately severe depression, whereas 18.1% were severely suffering from anxiety. The binary logistic regression suggests that older students have greater depression (OR = 2.886, 95% CI = 0.961-8.669). It is also evident that students who provided private tuition in the pre-pandemic period had depression (OR = 1.199, 95% CI = 0.736-1.952). It is expected that both the government and universities could work together to fix the academic delays and financial problems to reduce depression and anxiety among university students.Copyright: Â© 2020 Islam et al.

At the core of our system is a unified Reeb analysis framework for the detection and removal of geometric and topological outliers on tissue boundaries. Using intrinsic Reeb analysis  our system can pinpoint the location of spurious branches and topological outliers  and correct them with localized filtering using information from both image intensity distributions and geometric regularity. In this system  we have also developed enhanced tissue classification with Hessian features for improved robustness to image inhomogeneity  and adaptive interpolation to achieve sub-voxel accuracy in reconstructed surfaces. By integrating these novel developments  we have a system that can automatically reconstruct cortical surfaces with improved quality and dramatically reduced computational cost as compared with the popular FreeSurfer software. In our experiments  we demonstrate on 40 simulated MR images and the MR images of 200 subjects from two databases: the Alzheimer窶冱 Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and International Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM)  the robustness of our method in large scale studies. In comparisons with FreeSurfer  we show that our system is able to generate surfaces that better represent cortical anatomy and produce thickness features with higher statistical power in population studies.',\n",

In May 2020, the adult UVA CF program redesigned the care model to adjust to the reopening of ambulatory operations and introduced hybrid clinics. The goal remained to minimize person-to-person contacts for patients and care team members (CTMs) while ensuring patient access to quarterly, coproduced, synchronous, multidisciplinary CF care, similar to pre-COVID-19 era regular CF care. Methods: Using quality improvement tools, the UVA adult CF program created a standardized hybrid model of care for in-clinic visits, which included combined components of in-person and synchronous virtual interactions with members of the multidisciplinary team. Results: A total of 16 hybrid visits occurred between May 14 and June 11, 2020. All hybrid visits were multidisciplinary and fulfilled patient requests to see CTMs. All patients seen by hybrid encounter participated in coproduced agenda setting, underwent spirometry, and obtained blood work; 75% provided sputum for surveillance culture. Each hybrid visit type was attended by an average of four CTMs and amounted to 63 separate interactions. Of these interactions, 28 were completed virtually, reducing in-person contacts and personal protection equipment utilization by 44% compared with a fully in-person model of care. Conclusions: Combining in-person and telehealth components in a multidisciplinary CF care model reduces patient and staff interactions and personal protective equipment utilization. The hybrid model of in-person/remote combined care enables reliable access to biological data to support medical decision making while mitigating the risks of person-to-person contact for patients and staff.\",\n",

Objective(s): This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. Method(s): 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. Result(s): Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from \"nonsevere\" toward \"nonsurvived\" via \"severe and survived\" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. Conclusion(s): Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings may be helpful in predicting disease progression and clinical outcome of severe patients.Copyright Â© 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Circular dichroism and endogenous tryptophan fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the secondary and tertiary structures  respectively  are sensitive to increasing concentrations of Ca(2+). Isothermal titration calorimetry was then used to characterize the Ca(2+)-BACE1 interaction in more detail. Our results suggest that there is a high affinity of binding (k(d) = 2.0 x microM) between Ca(2+) and BACE1 and that the binding process was exothermic (DeltaH= -3.5 kcal/mol).

The main characteristics of the virus are rapid transmission, high contagion capacity and potential severity. The objective of this case series study is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) admitted to different intensive care units in Argentina for mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A descriptive, prospective, multicenter case series study was conducted between April 1 and May 8, 2020. Data from patients older than 18 years who were admitted to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: The variables for 47 patients from 31 intensive care units were recorded: 78.7% were men (median age of 61 years), with a SAPS II score of 43 and a Charlson index score of 3. The initial ventilatory mode was volume control - continuous mandatory ventilation with a tidal volume less than 8mL/kg in 100% of cases, with a median positive end-expiratory pressure of 10.5cmH2O.

As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. Methods and findings Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5 +/- 5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6 +/- 3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown.Copyright Â© 2020 Pinotti et al.

Interest in using MRI parameters as surrogate markers of disease to assess therapies is increasing. In patients with symptomatic sporadic small vessel disease  we determined which MRI parameters best correlated with cognitive function on cross-sectional analysis and which changed over a period of 1 year. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with lacunar stroke and leukoaraiosis were recruited. They underwent multimodal MRI (brain volume  fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion load  lacunar infarct number  fractional anisotropy  and mean diffusivity from diffusion tensor imaging) and neuropsychological testing. Twenty-seven agreed to reattend for repeat MRI and neuropsychology at 1 year. RESULTS: An executive function score correlated most strongly with diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy histogram  r=-0.640  P=0.004) and brain volume (r=0.501  P=0.034). Associations with diffusion tensor imaging were stronger than with all other MRI parameters. On multiple regression of all imaging parameters  a model that contained brain volume and fractional anisotropy  together with age  gender  and premorbid IQ  explained 74% of the variance of the executive function score (P=0.0001). Changes in mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were detectable over the 1-year follow-up; in contrast  no change in other MRI parameters was detectable over this time period. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal MRI model explains a large proportion of the variation in executive function in cerebral small vessel disease. In particular  diffusion tensor imaging correlates best with executive function and is the most sensitive to change. This supports the use of MRI  in particular diffusion tensor imaging  as a surrogate marker in treatment trials.',\n",

Despite previous studies of memory processes in KS  questions remain regarding the nature and severity of these impairments and identification of brain systems that underlie these different memory impairments. This study examined remote and anterograde memory function in 5 KS patients in comparison with 8 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 24 normal control subjects (NC). In addition  relationships between memory performance and regional brain volumes were examined in the KS group. Overall  the KS group showed severe impairment on both remote and anterograde memory measures  performing at the level of the AD group on most measures. Differences were observed on the pattern of temporal gradient for verbal recognition  with KS exhibiting a more steeply graded rate of decline over the most recent period examined. Severity of the remote memory deficit in KS was not associated with severity of anterograde memory deficit. Examination of brain structure-function relationships in the KS subjects revealed that photo naming of remote historical information was related to posterior cortical white matter volumes but not hippocampal volumes; sequencing was related to prefrontal but not hippocampal volumes. By contrast  a measure of anterograde memory for nonverbal visual material showed a relationship to hippocampal but not regional cortical white matter volumes. This set of dissociations  which parallels that observed in our earlier study of AD  is now documented in KS and provides further evidence that these separate cortical and limbic brain systems are principal neural substrates of the remote and anterograde memory and sequencing deficits in KS.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Feature Selection Based on Machine Learning in MRIs for Hippocampal Segmentation.Neurodegenerative diseases are frequently associated with structural changes in the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can show these variations and therefore can be used as a supportive feature for a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The hippocampus has been known to be a biomarker for Alzheimer disease and other neurological and psychiatric diseases. However  it requires accurate  robust  and reproducible delineation of hippocampal structures. Fully automatic methods are usually the voxel based approach; for each voxel a number of local features were calculated. In this paper  we compared four different techniques for feature selection from a set of 315 features extracted for each voxel: (i) filter method based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; two wrapper methods  respectively  (ii) sequential forward selection and (iii) sequential backward elimination; and (iv) embedded method based on the Random Forest Classifier on a set of 10 T1-weighted brain MRIs and tested on an independent set of 25 subjects. The resulting segmentations were compared with manual reference labelling. By using only 23 feature for each voxel (sequential backward elimination) we obtained comparable state-of-the-art performances with respect to the standard tool FreeSurfer.',\n",

To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.',\n",

The first Italian cases occurred in February 2020: since then, there has been an exponential increase in new cases, hospitalizations and intensive care assistance demand. This new and sudden scenario led to a forced National Health System reorganization and review of welfare priorities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of this pandemic on ordinary activities in two plastic surgery divisions in Rome, hosted in a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 hospital. Methods: The data of this comparative retrospective study was collected between 9 March and 9 April 2019 and the same period of 2020 from two plastic surgery units, one in a COVID-19 hospital and second in a non-COVID-19 hospital in Rome, Italy. The 2019-2020 data of the two hospitals was compared regarding the number of surgeries, post-operative dressings and first consultations performed. Results: Both units sustained a decrease in workload due to lockdown effects. Statistically significant differences for day surgery procedures (p value = 0.0047) and first consultations (p value < 0.0001) were found between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 institutes, with a drastic trend limiting non-urgent access to COVID-19 hospitals. Conclusions: The long-term effects of healthcare reshuffling in the \"COVID-19 era\" imply a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer and cancellation of many reconstructive procedures. These findings pose a question on the future consequences of a long-term limitation in plastic surgery healthcare.Level of evidence: Level III, risk/prognostic study.

The PET/CT scanner is an evolution in technology combining two well-developed imaging modalities: anatomical imaging with CT and functional imaging with PET. The first prototype PET/CT scanner was a consequence of a succession of steps that  in chronological order  included the development of the High Density Avalanche Chamber (HIDAC) PET camera  3-D PET methodology and the rotating partial-ring tomograph (PRT). The successful completion of each step was a prerequisite to progress to the next phase  and the lessons learned could then be applied to subsequent initiatives.

However  changes in the tumor size  tumor vascular permeability  vascular density  expression of VEGFR2 and other angiogenic factors in response to PTK787 are not well documented. This study was to determine the changes in tumor size  vascular permeability  fractional plasma volume and expression of VEGFR2 in PTK787 treated U-251 glioma rat model by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The findings were validated with histochemical and western blot studies.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using a high molecular weight contrast agent albumin-(GdDTPA) showed significantly increased K <sup>trans</sup> at the rim of the treated tumors compared to that of the central part of the treated as well as the untreated (vehicle treated) tumors. Size of the tumors was also increased in the treated group. Expression of VEGFR2 detected by Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF SPECT also showed significantly increased activity in the treated tumors. In PTK787-treated tumors  histological staining revealed increase in microvessel density in the close proximity to the tumor border. Western blot analysis indicated increased expression of VEGF  SDF-1  HIF-1α  VEGFR2  VEGFR3 and EGFR at the peripheral part of the treated tumors compared to that of central part of the treated tumors.

In the present study  16 patients with a progressive form of non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) were asked to tell a story from a wordless children's picture book. Errors in production were classified as either phonemic  involving language-based deformations that nevertheless result in possible sequences of English speech segments; or phonetic  involving a motor planning deficit and resulting in non-English speech segments. The distribution of cortical atrophy as revealed by structural MRI scans was examined quantitatively in a subset of PNFA patients (N=7). The few errors made by healthy seniors were only phonemic in type. PNFA patients made more than four times as many errors as controls. This included both phonemic and phonetic errors  with a preponderance of errors (82%) classified as phonemic. The majority of phonemic errors were substitutions that shared most distinctive features with the target phoneme. The systematic nature of these substitutions is not consistent with a motor planning deficit. Cortical atrophy was found in prefrontal regions bilaterally and peri-Sylvian regions of the left hemisphere. We conclude that the speech errors produced by PNFA patients are mainly errors at the phonemic level of language processing and are not caused by a motor planning impairment.\",\n",

Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARSCoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence.

However  myelomatous pleural effusions (MPE) which are effusions directly related to infiltration of the pleura by plasma cells  are extremely rare. Case Description: A 66 year old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department with three week history of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue. Her past medical history was significant for IgA light chain multiple myeloma and hyperparathyroidism for which she had underwent parathyroidectomy. She had undergone multiple chemotherapy regimens including bortezomib  carfilzomib  Cytoxan  thalidomide and lenalilomide with failure to respond. At presentation  she was afebrile  heart rate of 120 beats/min  respiratory rate of 38 breaths/min  oxygen saturation of 95% on 55% venti mask and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. Her physical examination was remarkable for stony dullness and reduced breath sounds on the right side of the chest. Initial laboratory investigations were significant for white cell count of 1 x 103 cells/mm3  hemoglobin 6.0 g/dl  and creatinine of 8.12 mg/dl and BUN 100 mg/dl. Chest x-ray demonstrated complete opacification of the right lung with mediastinal shift to the left. She underwent ultrasound guided thoracentesis and 1.7 L of serous fluid was removed. Pleural fluid analysis revealed white cells of 575/uL with 56% atypical cells  exudative fluid as per Lights criteria. On detailed cytological analysis  these atypical cells were single enlarged cells with eccentric nuclei  and were immunoreactive to CD138 supporting plasma cell differentiation (Figure) . She was treated with hemodialysis and plasmapheresis for renal failure due to myeloma kidney. Recurrent pleural fluid accumulation was treated with pigtail catheter and this relieved her shortness of breath. Hence  the diagnosis made as large right true MPE. Discussion: MPE occurs equally among both genders  is typically hemorrhagic and commonly on the left. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by cytologic identification of malignant plasma cells  high levels of a monoclonal protein in the pleural fluid and histological study of pleural biopsy. Role of flow cytometry of pleural fluid has been studied as a potentially useful and simple diagnostic tool (positive for CD56  CD38 and CD138 and negative for CD19). Patients also frequently have elevated serum β2-microglobulin  serum lactate dehydrogenase  and creatinine. Unfortunately  the outcome of these patients has not been favorable and they are usually found resistant to multiple chemotherapies. The median survival can vary between months to years.

Like Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD)  PMLD is characterized clinically by nystagmus  cerebellar ataxia  and spasticity  due to a permanent lack of myelin deposition in the brain. Mutations in the GJA12 gene  encoding connexin 47 (Cx47)  were recently reported in five children with autosomal recessive PMLD. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of mutations in the GJA12 gene in  and define the clinical and neuroimaging features of  autosomal recessive PMLD. RESULTS: The authors screened for GJA12 mutations in 10 additional PMLD families originating from Italy  Pakistan  and Saudi Arabia. Three novel homozygous GJA12 mutations were identified in 12 mutant cases distributed in 3 of 10 families. The mutations segregated with the disease according to an autosomal recessive trait and included one missense (G236S) and two nonsense (L281fs285X and P131fs144X) changes. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of homozygous mutations predicting the synthesis of aberrant and truncated polypeptides  and their tight segregation with the disease in very large families  clearly demonstrate that the loss of Cx47 function is the cause of the disease. The phenotype of GJA12-related Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease is fairly homogeneous and similar to that of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. However  slower progression of symptoms  greater preservation of cognitive functions  and partial myelination of corticospinal tracts at MRI were distinctive features  which could help in the differential diagnosis.',\n",

This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of liver blood tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The analysis included clinical data of 23 patients with suspected COVID-19 and 66 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from January 25 to February 20, 2020. The relationship between liver blood test results, liver condition (HBsAb positive, HBcAb positive, and fatty liver disease), and duration of hospital stay among COVID-19 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median hospital stay of COVID-19 patients was 6 days. Serum albumin (Alb) level was lower in patients with COVID-19 confirmed on admission than in patients with suspected COVID-19 (40.08 g/L vs 42.50 g/L, P = .016), while the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher (23 U/L vs 18 U/L, P = .005). Abnormal results of liver blood tests in patients with COVID-19 included increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (21.2%, 14 patients), AST (15.2%, 10 patients), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (22.7%, 15 patients). After 5-10 days of treatment, levels of Alb and AST in COVID-19 patients were significantly decreased (P < .001 and P = .027, respectively). Abnormal levels of Alb and AST in patients with COVID-19 were not associated with the liver condition (all P > .05). In addition, only levels of AST were positively correlated with the duration of hospital stay (r = .334, P = .007). CONCLUSION: Abnormal results of the liver blood test were found in COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 patients on admission with the higher levels of AST might have longer hospital stays.

Clinically  it is characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment with structural hallmarks of cortical atrophy and ventricular expansion. Amyloid plaque aggregation is also known to occur in AD subjects. In-vivo imaging of amyloid plaques is now possible with positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands. PET imaging suffers from a degrading phenomenon known as the partial volume effect (PVE). The quantitative accuracy of PET images is reduced by PVEs primarily due to the limited spatial resolution of the scanner. The degree of PVE is influenced by structure size  with smaller structures tending to suffer from more severe PVEs such as atrophied grey matter regions. The aims of this paper were to investigate the effect of partial volume correction (PVC) on the quantification of amyloid PET and to highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate PVC technique. METHODS: An improved PVC technique  region-based voxel-wise (RBV) correction  was compared against existing Van-Cittert (VC) and Mﾃｼller-Gﾃ､rtner (MG) methods using amyloid PET imaging data. Digital phantom data were produced using segmented MRI scans from a control subject and an AD subject. Typical tracer distributions were generated for each of the phantom anatomies. Also examined were 70 clinical PET scans acquired using [(18)F]flutemetamol. Volume of interest (VOI) analysis was performed for corrected and uncorrected images. RESULTS: PVC was shown to improve the quantitative accuracy of regional analysis performed on amyloid PET images. Of the corrections applied  VC deconvolution demonstrated the worst recovery of grey matter values. MG PVC was shown to induce biases in some grey matter regions due to grey matter variability. In addition  white matter variability was shown to influence the accuracy of MG PVC in cortical grey matter and also cerebellar grey matter  a typical reference region for amyloid PET normalization in sporadic AD. RBV was shown to be more accurate than MG in terms of grey matter and white matter uptake. An increase in within-group variability after PVC was observed and is believed to be a genuine  more accurate representation of the data rather than a correction-induced error. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) threshold for classifying subjects as either amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative was found to be 1.64 in the uncorrected dataset  rising to 2.25 after PVC. CONCLUSION: Care should be taken when applying PVC to amyloid PET images. Assumptions made in existing PVC strategies can induce biases that could lead to erroneous inferences about uptake in certain regions. The proposed RBV PVC technique accounts for within-compartment variability  with the potential to reduce errors of this kind.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Pflege in Zeiten von Corona: Zentrale Ergebnisse einer deutschlandweiten Querschnittsbefragung vollstationarer PflegeheimeLong-term care during the Corona pandemic - Main results from a nationwide online survey in nursing homes in Germany Abstract. Background: As a highly vulnerable group, people in need of long-term care are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to their care-dependency, measures of social distancing can only be carried out to a very limited extent. In addition, the social and health consequences of reduced contacts are particularly high for nursing home residents. AIM: The study aims to describe the extent to which nursing homes are affected, the human and material resources of nursing homes, the organizational handling of the situation, and their requests for public support. METHODS: More than 7,000 nursing homes were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements. Data analysis applies descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 824 nursing homes participated in the survey. One in five nursing homes has at least one confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 among its residents and / or employees. The initial lack of protective equipment has now decreased, but the facilities still have to cope with additional corona-related care needs with reduced staff. Nursing homes have banned contacts between residents and relative to an extent that now has to be reduced again. Nursing homes demand the provision and external financing of protective equipment as well as the systematic and regular testing of nursing staff and the provision of uniform guidelines for action throughout Germany. CONCLUSIONS: As about half of all deceased people with COVID-19 have been living in nursing homes, the support of nursing homes in their attempt to restrict the pandemic requires highest attention.',\n",

We describe protocols and first results of the Ion AmpliSeq TM SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel by a massively parallel sequencing (MPS) assay. The panel allows for targeted sequencing by overlapping amplicons, thereby providing specific, accurate, and high throughput analysis. A modified reverse transcription reaction, which consists of the use of a SARS-CoV-2 specific primers pool from the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel, was assessed in order to promote viral RNA specific reverse transcription. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ion AmpliSeq TM SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel in sequencing the entire viral genome in different samples. SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were obtained from ten viral isolates and one nasopharyngeal swab from different patients. The ten isolate samples amplified with 12 PCR cycles displayed high mean depth values compared to those of the two isolates amplified with 20 PCR cycles. High mean depth values were also obtained for the nasopharyngeal swab processed by use of a target-specific reverse transcription. The relative depth of coverage (rDoC) analysis showed that when 12 PCR cycles were used, all target regions were amplified with high sequencing coverage, while in libraries amplified at 20 cycles, a poor uniformity of amplification, with absent or low coverage of many target regions, was observed. Our results show that the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel can achieve rapid and high throughput SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing from 10 ng of DNA-free viral RNA from isolates and from 1 ng of DNA-free viral RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab using 12 PCR cycles for library amplification. The modified RT-PCR protocol yielded superior results on the nasopharyngeal swab compared to the reverse transcription reaction set up according to the manufacturer's instructions.\",\n",

METHODS: We sent an online 22-item questionnaire to patients from our outpatient clinic, a reference center in Spain for drug-resistant epilepsy, inquiring about the effects of lockdown, from March to May 2020. RESULTS: We sent the survey to 627 patients; 312 (58% women) sent a complete response and were included. Of all respondents, 57% took >2 antiseizure medications. One-third of respondents (29%) declared an associated cognitive or motor disability. A minority had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 (1.92%). Seizure frequency remained like usual in 56% of patients, while 31.2% reported an increase. Less than 10% needed emergent assistance. Almost half reported anxiety or depression, and 25% increased behavioral disorders. Mood (F: 5.40 ; p: 0.002) and sleep disorders (F= 2.67; p:0.05) were associated with increase in seizure frequency. Patients were able to contact their physicians when needed and were open to a future telematic approach to follow up visits. CONCLUSIONS: Seizure frequency and severity remained unchanged in most patients during the lockdown. Mood and sleep disorders were common and associated with seizure worsening.

The results of a series of difference-in-difference regression models reveal that the severity of stay-at-home restrictions increased overall food prices by 1% in March 2020, compared to January and February 2020. The price level for food continued to rise in the high stay-at-home restriction countries relative to thier counterpart in April but stabilised in May. The food categories that witnessed the most significant surges in prices were meat, fish & seafood, and vegetables. The prices of bread & cereals, fruits, milk, cheese & eggs and oils & fats were not significantly affected. The correlations between food prices and stay-at-home restrictions were significant after controlling for cross-country variations in COVID-19 affectedness and other mitigation and adaptation measures, such as international travel controls, road closures and the size of the economic stimulus packages.

AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neurofibrillary plaques and tangles in the brain that leads to neuronal death and dementia. Early diagnosis of AD is still a major unresolved health concern: several biomarkers are being investigated  among which the electroencephalogram (EEG) provides the only option for an electrophysiological information. In this study  EEG signals obtained from 161 subjects--79 with AD  and 82 age-matched controls (CN)--are analyzed using several nonlinear signal complexity measures. These measures include: Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD)  spectral entropy (SE)  spectral centroid (SC)  spectral roll-off (SR)  and zero-crossing rate (ZCR). HFD is a quantitative measure of time series complexity derived from fractal theory. Among spectral measures  SE measures the level of disorder in the spectrum  SC is a measure of spectral shape  and SR is frequency sample below which a specified percent of the spectral magnitude distribution is contained. Lastly  ZCR is simply the rate at which the signal changes signs. A t-test was first applied to determine those features that provide significant differences between the groups. Those features were then used to train a neural network. The classification accuracies ranged from 60-66%  suggesting they contain some discriminatory information; however  not enough to be clinically useful alone. Combining these features and training a support vector machine (SVM) resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of 78%  indicating that these feature carry complementary information.\",\n",

Objective: To analyze the full clinical course and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectability in children confirmed with COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea, where rigorous public health interventions have been implemented. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series of children with COVID-19 was conducted in 20 hospitals and 2 nonhospital isolation facilities across the country from February 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Children younger than 19 years who had COVID-19 were included. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19, detected via SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or sputum by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical manifestations during the observation period, including the time and duration of symptom occurrence. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was also analyzed. Results: A total of 91 children with COVID-19 were included (median [range] age, 11 [0-18] years; 53 boys [58%]). Twenty children (22%) were asymptomatic during the entire observation period. Among 71 symptomatic cases, 47 children (66%) had unrecognized symptoms before diagnosis, 18 (25%) developed symptoms after diagnosis, and only 6 (9%) were diagnosed at the time of symptom onset. Twenty-two children (24%) had lower respiratory tract infections. The mean (SD) duration of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory samples was 17.6 (6.7) days. Virus RNA was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.1 (7.7) days in asymptomatic individuals. There was no difference in the duration of virus RNA detection between children with upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 18.7 [5.8] days vs 19.9 [5.6] days; P = .54).

This differential benefit from cueing suggests that different neurocognitive functions are impaired in these two groups. Patients with frontal lobe dysfunction are presumed to have difficulty with the executive aspects of this generative fluency task  whereas patients with temporal lobe impairment are limited by deficits in semantic memory. We studied the performance of patients with complex partial seizures of frontal or temporal lobe onset  as determined by video/EEG monitoring  on standard and cued measures of semantic fluency administered in a counterbalanced sequence across groups. These groups did not differ significantly in terms of age  education  gender  age at seizure onset  total number of antiepileptic drugs  or IQ  and all patients subsequently underwent surgery for intractable epilepsy.

Methods: Thirty-eight children and adolescents with PACD who underwent MRI, TPUS, and gross colonoscopic examination under sedation were included. Fistulae were classified according to Parks' and St. James's University Hospital classifications. Abscesses were identified by their presence and location on each modality. Results: Fifty-nine fistulae (26 superficial, 23 intersphincteric, 10 transsphincteric) and 16 abscesses were detected using MRI. Fifty-nine fistulae and 10 abscesses were detected using TPUS. Forty-five fistulae (sensitivity 76.3%, positive predictive value [PPV] 84.2%, and kappa value 0.296] and 9 abscesses (sensitivity 56.3%, PPV 90.0%, and kappa value 0.624) on TPUS corresponded with MRI findings.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of nonanomalous live-born singletons with birth weight (BWT) ¿= 4 kg and biometry within 14 days of birth. Formula accuracy included: (1) mean error (ME = EFW - BWT)  (2) absolute mean error (AME = absolute value of [1])  and (3) mean percent error (MPE  [1]/BWT x 100%). Using loge BWT as the dependent variable  multivariable linear regression produced a macrosomic-specific formula in a \"training\" dataset which was verified by \"validation\" data. Formulas specific for MDM were also developed.  RESULTS: Out of the 403 pregnancies  birth gestational age was 39.5 +/- 1.4 weeks  and median BWT was 4 240 g.

Using APOE knock-in mice  we have previously shown that APOE-ﾎｵ4 Targeted Replacement (TR) mice have fewer dendritic spines and reduced branching in cortical neurons. As dendritic spines are post-synaptic sites of excitatory neurotransmission  we used APOE TR mice to examine whether APOE genotype affected the various elements of the glutamate-glutamine cycle. We found that levels of glutamine synthetase and glutamate uptake transporters were unchanged among the APOE genotypes. However  compared with APOE-ﾎｵ3 TR mice  APOE-ﾎｵ4 TR mice had decreased glutaminase levels (18%  p < 0.05)  suggesting decreased conversion of glutamine to glutamate. APOE-ﾎｵ4 TR mice also had increased levels of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (20%  p < 0.05)  suggesting that APOE genotype affects pre-synaptic terminal composition. To address whether these changes affected normal neurotransmission  we examined the production and metabolism of glutamate and glutamine at 4-5 months and 1 year. Using high-frequency (13)C/(1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  we found that APOE-ﾎｵ4 TR mice have decreased production of glutamate and increased levels of glutamine. These factors may contribute to the increased risk of neurodegeneration associated with APOE-ﾎｵ4  and also act as surrogate markers for Alzheimer's disease risk.\",\n",

The clinical course among non-pregnant women has been described but data about potential risks for women and their fetus remain scarce. The SARS and MERS epidemics were responsible for miscarriages, adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes and maternal deaths. For COVID-19 infection, only 9 cases of maternal death have been reported as of April 22, 2020 and pregnant women seem to develop the same clinical presentation as the general population. However, severe maternal cases, as well as prematurity, fetal distress and stillbirth among newborns have been reported. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic greatly impacts prenatal management and surveillance and raise the need for clear unanimous guidelines. In this narrative review, we describe the current knowledge about coronaviruses (SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2) risks and consequences on pregnancies and we summarize available current candidate therapeutic options for pregnant women. Finally, we compare current guidance proposed by RCOG, ACOG and the WHO to give an overview of prenatal management which should be utilized until future data appear.

There is, however, no effective antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), we extended a recently developed approach, EvoDesign, to design multiple peptide sequences that can competitively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to inhibit the virus from entering human cells. The protocol starts with the construction of a hybrid peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from the interface of the hACE2 protein (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, which is followed by the redesign and refinement simulations of the peptide sequence to optimize its binding affinity to the interface of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The binding experiment analyses showed that the designed peptides exhibited a significantly stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type hACE2 receptor (with -53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit scores for the top designed and wild-type peptides, respectively). This study demonstrates a new avenue to utilize computationally designed peptide motifs to treat the COVID-19 disease by blocking the critical spike-RBD and hACE2 interactions.',\n",

Little is known about the progression of either VaD or AD+CVD. The aim of this study was to compare demographic features  cognitive decline and survival of patients with VaD  AD+CVD and AD alone attending a memory clinic. METHODS: This study included 970 patients who were followed at the Lille-Bailleul memory clinic  France. Cognitive functions were measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS). Survival rate was analysed with a left-truncated Cox model. Analyses were adjusted for age  sex  education  hypertension  diabetes and baseline MMSE and DRS. RESULTS: Of 970 patients  141 had VaD  663 AD alone and 166 AD+CVD. The latter were significantly older than AD or VaD patients at onset (71 (SD 7) vs 69 (9) and 68 (9) years  p = 0.01) and at first visit (75 (6) vs 73 (8) and 72 (8) years  p = 0.0002). Baseline MMSE and DRS evaluations were highest for VaD compared with AD alone or AD+CVD patients (p<0.006). Cognitive decline during follow-up was slowest for VaD  intermediate for AD+CVD and fastest for AD alone (p = 0.03). After adjustment  compared with AD patients  mortality risk was similar for those with VaD (relative mortality risk (RR) = 0.7 (0.5 to 1.1)) and tended to be lower for AD+CVD (RR = 0.7 (0.5 to 1.0)).

To investigate such events we have developed cell systems mimicking the interactions between beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP)-expressing neurons and brain mononuclear phagocytes (MP; macrophages and microglia). MP were co-cultured with neuronal cells expressing wild type APP or familial AD-linked APP mutants. The latter was derived from recombinant adenoviral constructs. Neuronal APP processing products induced MP activation  reactive oxygen species  and neurotoxic activities. These occurred without the addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and were reversed by depletion of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and secreted APP (sAPP). Neurotoxic activities were diminished by superoxide dismutase mimetics and NMDA receptor inhibitors. Microglial glutamate secretion was suppressed by the cystine-glutamate antiporter inhibitor and its levels paralleled the depletion of sAPP and Abeta from conditioned media prepared from APP-expressing neurons. The excitotoxins from activated MP were potent enough to evoke recombinant NMDA receptor-mediated inward currents expressed in vitro in the Xenopus oocytes. These results demonstrate that neuronal APP-processing products can induce oxidative neurotoxicity through microglial activation.\",\n",

In studies of Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD)  the cerebellum is often used as a reference region  assuming that it is spared any major pathological involvement. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) may enhance the evaluation of SPECT scans in ATD patients. However  current SPM software only allows scaling to average whole brain activity (i.e.  global normalization). The aim of this study was to develop an easily applied  objective  and reproducible method for determining average cerebellar tracer uptake so that images can be scaled specifically to cerebellar activity prior to the performance of SPM analysis. We also investigated whether cerebellar normalization increases the sensitivity and specificity of SPM analysis of ATD patients compared with global normalization. METHODS: Image files were taken from a parallel study investigating the use of SPECT as a diagnostic tool for early onset of ATD. Two methods for determining cerebellar activity were developed: one manually  using templates  the other automated  using specified coordinates entered into a Matlab routine. Group comparison of ATD patients versus controls (= healthy volunteers and depressed patients) was performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using SPM 96 on Windows 95. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were computed for 20 student raters examining patient and control scans with and without single-subject SPMs. RESULTS: The reduction of cerebral blood flow in the group of ATD patients appeared 1.7 times greater in spatial extent when the tracer uptake was normalized to cerebellum rather than to average whole brain activity. Computing the reverse contrast (reductions in the control group compared with ATD patients) produced clusters of significance in globally normalized images which were not manifest after normalizing to cerebellum. This is consistent with the notion that the cerebellum is spared in ATD. Analysis of the area under the ROC curve showed that cerebellar-normalized SPM produced significantly improved accuracy over perfusion scans alone. CONCLUSION: An easily applied  objective  reproducible method was developed for normalizing images to cerebellum prior to the performance of SPM analysis. Cerebellar normalization produced more extensive abnormalities in SPM analyses of ATD patients than global normalization. Furthermore  cerebellar normalization produced marginally more accurate diagnostic results in single-scan SPM analysis of ATD patients than did global normalization.\",\n",

METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective study based on prospective data collection of 100 successive patients who attended an epilepsy outpatient clinic either face-to-face or telephonically during the months of the COVID-19 outbreak and national state of emergency. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, 52% women, mean age 42.4years. During the COVID-19 period, 27% of the patients presented an increase of >50% of seizure frequency. An increase of stress/anxiety (odds ratios (OR): 5.78; p=0.008) and a prior higher seizure frequency (OR: 12.4; p=0.001) were associated with worsening of seizures. Other risk factors were exacerbation of depression, sleep deprivation, less physical activity, and history of epilepsy surgery. Three patients had status epilepticus (SE) and one a cluster of seizures. Likewise, 9% of patients improved their seizure control. Reduction in stress/anxiety (OR: 0.05; p=0.03) and recent adjustment of antiepileptics (OR: 0.07; p=0.01) acted as protecting factors. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of PWE suffered a significant worsening of their seizure control during the months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emotional distress due to home confinement was the main factor for the change in seizure control.

The right caudolateral OFC responded preferentially to pleasant compared to unpleasant taste  irrespective of intensity  and the left dorsal anterior insula/operculuar region responded preferentially to unpleasant compared to pleasant tastes equated for intensity. Responses best characterized as an interaction between intensity and pleasantness were also observed in several limbic regions. These findings demonstrate a functional segregation within the human gustatory system. They also show that amygdala activity may be driven by stimulus intensity irrespective of valence  casting doubt upon the notion that the amygdala responds preferentially to negative stimuli.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Microarray RNA expression analysis of cerebral white matter lesions reveals changes in multiple functional pathways.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter lesions (WML) in brain aging are linked to dementia and depression. Ischemia contributes to their pathogenesis but other mechanisms may contribute. We used RNA microarray analysis with functional pathway grouping as an unbiased approach to investigate evidence for additional pathogenetic mechanisms. METHODS: WML were identified by MRI and pathology in brains donated to the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study Cognitive Function and Aging Study. RNA was extracted to compare WML with nonlesional white matter samples from cases with lesions (WM[L])  and from cases with no lesions (WM[C]) using RNA microarray and pathway analysis. Functional pathways were validated for selected genes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: We identified 8 major pathways in which multiple genes showed altered RNA transcription (immune regulation  cell cycle  apoptosis  proteolysis  ion transport  cell structure  electron transport  metabolism) among 502 genes that were differentially expressed in WML compared to WM[C]. In WM[L]  409 genes were altered involving the same pathways. Genes selected to validate this microarray data all showed the expected changes in RNA levels and immunohistochemical expression of protein. CONCLUSIONS: WML represent areas with a complex molecular phenotype. From this and previous evidence  WML may arise through tissue ischemia but may also reflect the contribution of additional factors like blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Differential expression of genes in WM[L] compared to WM[C] indicate a \"field effect\" in the seemingly normal surrounding white matter.',\n",

In many learning tasks  particular 'dimensions' of stimulus information are relevant whilst others are irrelevant; therefore  efficient performance depends on identifying the dimensions of these 'compound' stimuli and selecting the relevant dimension for further processing. We investigated the ability of patients with PD  as well as patients with Huntington's disease and patients with frontal or temporal lobe lesions  to learn visual discriminations which required either a number of associations to be learned concurrently (the 'eight-pair' task) or the selection of information from compound stimuli (the 'five-dimension' task)  both tasks being learned by trial-and-error. None of the basal ganglia disorder patient groups was impaired on the eight-pair task  militating against a crucial role for these brain structures in trial-and-error learning per se. Patients with mild  medicated PD  but not unmedicated PD patients  were impaired at identifying all five feature dimensions in the five-dimension task  implying dopaminergic 'overdosing' of the ability to analyse compound stimuli in terms of their component dimensions. Temporal lobe lesion patients performed similarly  suggesting that the temporal lobe may be the site of the medication overdose effect. Patients with severe  medicated PD were impaired at compound discrimination learning on the five-dimension task in the absence of an underlying impairment in identifying component stimulus dimensions; this pattern resembled that seen in Huntington's disease and frontal lobe lesion patients  implying that fronto-striatal circuitry is involved in the formation of rules based upon selected stimulus dimensions.\",\n",

However  the status of this receptor in mild or prodromal AD has remained the subject of controversy. METHODS: We compared alpha(4)beta(2)-nAChR availability in 8 brain regions of living human subjects who had AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with that in age-matched healthy control subjects by using the ligand (123)I-5-IA-85380 ((123)I-5-IA) and SPECT. All subjects (n = 32) were nonsmokers; they were administered (123)I-5-IA as a bolus plus a constant infusion and imaged 6-8 h later under equilibrium conditions. The effect of diagnosis on regional alpha(4)beta(2)-nAChR availability (regional brain activity/total parent concentration in plasma  proportional to the binding potential) was analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance  controlling for the effects of age and sex. RESULTS: Despite a significant overall effect of diagnostic group on mean alpha(4)beta(2)-nAChR availability  univariate analyses revealed no group differences for any brain region analyzed. An exploratory analysis of the relationship between regional alpha(4)beta(2)-nAChR availability and neuropsychologic variables yielded several plausible correlations. However  after Bonferroni adjustment  only the correlation between the anterior cingulate and the Trail Making Test  Part B  in the healthy control subjects remained significant. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with several postmortem and in vivo studies suggesting the preservation of nAChRs during the prodromal and early stages of AD.

We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2' or 3' modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3'-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2'-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2'-F-dUTP, 2'-NH2-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2'-OH at the 3'-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading. In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs. The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2'-OH, have a blocked 2'-OH, or show delayed termination. Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity. Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established. After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for COVID-19. Copyright B) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Computational models consider the GP to be part of a basal ganglia network involved in cognitive processes related to the control of actions. We examined behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) correlates of action control (i.e.  error monitoring) and evaluated the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS). We did this using a standard flanker paradigm and evaluated error-related ERPs. Patients were recruited from a prospective pilot trial for pallidal DBS in HD (trial number NCT00902889). From the initial four patients with Huntington's chorea  two patients with chronic external dorsal pallidum stimulation were available for follow-up and able to perform the task. The results suggest that the external GP constitutes an important basal ganglia element not only for error processing and behavioural adaptation but for general response monitoring processes as well. Response monitoring functions were fully controllable by switching pallidal DBS stimulation on and off. When stimulation was switched off  no neurophysiological and behavioural signs of error and general performance monitoring  as reflected by the error-related negativity and post-error slowing in reaction times were evident. The modulation of response monitoring processes by GP-DBS reflects a side effect of efforts to alleviate motor symptoms in HD. From a clinical neurological perspective  the results suggest that DBS in the external GP segment can be regarded as a potentially beneficial treatment with respect to cognitive functions.\",\n",

These data are difficult to handle with standard inferential tools (e.g.  analysis of variance or factor analysis) whose assumptions are unfit for these data. This article presents multiblock discriminant correspondence analysis (MUDICA)  which is a recent method that can handle datasets not suited for standard inferential techniques. METHOD: MUDICA is illustrated with clinical data examining conversational trouble-source repair and topic maintenance in dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Seventeen DAT participant/spouse dyads (6 controls  5 participants with early DAT  6 participants with moderate DAT) produced spontaneous conversations analyzed for co-occurrence of trouble-source repair and topic maintenance variables. RESULTS: MUDICA found that trouble-source repair sequences and topic transitions are associated and that patterns of performance in the DAT groups differed significantly from those in the control group. CONCLUSION: MUDICA is ideally suited to analyze language and discourse data in communication disorders because it (a) can identify and predict clinical group membership based on patterns of performance  (b) can accommodate few participants and many variables  (c) can be used with categorical data  and (d) adds the rigor of inferential statistics.\",\n",

Recent work  however  has revealed that diffusion MRI that is able to detect white matter integrity changes may be an earlier or more sensitive biomarker in both diseases. However  studies that examine white matter changes only are limited in that they do not provide the functional specificity of GM region-based analysis. In this study  we develop a new metric called the Loss in Connectivity (LoCo) score that gives the amount of structural network disruption incurred by a gray matter region for a particular pattern of white matter integrity loss. Leveraging the relative strengths of WM and GM markers  this metric links areas of WM integrity loss to their connected GM regions as a first step in understanding their functional implications. The LoCo score is calculated for three groups: 18AD  18 FTD  and 19 age-matched normal controls. We show significant correlations of the LoCo with the respective atrophy patterns in AD (R=0.51  p=2.2 ﾃ 10(-9)) and FTD (R=0.49  p=2.5 ﾃ 10(-8)) for a standard 116 region gray matter atlas.

Though quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the method of choice for COVID-19 diagnostics, the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of the technique impairs its wide applicability in resource-constrained settings and calls for novel strategies to meet the ever-growing demand for more testing. In this context, a pooled sample testing strategy was evaluated in the setting of emerging disease outbreak in 3 central Indian districts to assess if the cost of the test and turn-around time could be reduced without compromising its diagnostic characteristics and thus lead to early containment of the outbreak. From 545 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples received from the three emerging districts, a total of 109 pools were created with 5 consecutive samples in each pool. The diagnostic performance of qRT-PCR on pooled sample was compared with that of individual samples in a blinded manner. While pooling reduced the cost of diagnosis by 68% and the laboratory processing time by 66%, 5 of the 109 pools showed discordant results when compared with induvial samples. Four pools which tested negative contained 1 positive sample and 1 pool which was positive did not show any positive sample on deconvolution. Presence of a single infected sample with Ct value of 34 or higher, in a pool of 5, was likely to be missed in pooled sample analysis. At the reported point prevalence of 4.8% in this study, the negative predictive value of qRT-PCR on pooled samples was around 96% suggesting that the adoption of this strategy as an effective screening tool for COVID-19 needs to be carefully evaluated.Copyright Â© 2020 Singh et al.

The protein is associated with process of microtubule assembly  which plays an important role in intracellular transport and cell structure of the neuron. Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases specifically associated with tau abnormalities. While a well-defined mechanism remains unknown  most facts point to tau as a prominent culprit in neurodegeneration. In most cases of Tauopathies  aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau have been found. Two proposals are present when discussing tau toxicity  one being the aggregation of tau proteins and the other points toward a conformational change within the protein. Previous work we carried out showed tau hyperphosphorylation promotes tau to behave abnormally resulting in microtubule assembly disruption as well as a breakdown in tau self-assembly. We found that tau's N-terminal region has a putative site for ATP/GTP binding. In this paper we demonstrate that tau is able to bind ATP and not GTP  that this binding induces tau self-assembly into filaments. At 1 mM ATP the filaments are 4-7 nm in width  whereas at 10 mM ATP the filaments appeared to establish lateral interaction  bundling and twisting  forming filaments that resembled the Paired Helical Filaments (PHF) isolated from Alzheimer disease brain.

Elevated levels of A beta(42) peptide formation have been linked to early-onset familial AD-causing gene mutations in the amyloid beta-protein precursor (A beta PP) and the presenilins. Sequential cleavage of A beta PP by the beta- and gamma-secretases generates the N- and C-termini of the A beta peptide  making both the beta- and gamma-secretase enzymes potential therapeutic targets for AD. The identity of the A beta PP gamma-secretase and the mechanism by which the C-termini of A beta are formed remain uncertain  although it has been suggested that the presenilins themselves are novel intramembrane-cleaving gamma-secretases of the aspartyl protease class [Wolfe  M.

Among the 10 cases of \"wrinkling shape\" lesions in the first CT examination, except for 1 case without reexamination, the remaining 9 cases had different degrees of absorption in the second CT examination. Among the 26 cases of \"wrinkling shape\" lesions in the second CT examination, except for 11 cases without reexamination, the other 15 patients had different degrees of absorption in the third CT examination. CONCLUSIONS: The early CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly ground-glass-density foci distributed in the subpleural region, some of which are distributed near the bronchial blood vessel bundle and in the central area of the lobule. As the course of the disease progresses, there may be varying degrees of solid components in the lesion. When the lesions show a \"wrinkling shape\", it is often suggested that the lesions will evolve towards the direction of absorption. These characteristics are of great value in assisting clinical diagnosis and dynamically observing changes undersuch condition.',\n",

Using Cre-lox conditional knockout mice  we demonstrate that lipoprotein receptor LRP1 expression regulates apoE and cholesterol levels within the CNS. We also found that deletion of APP and its homolog APLP2  or components of the gamma-secretase complex  significantly enhanced the expression and function of LRP1  which was reversed by forced expression of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We further show that AICD  together with Fe65 and Tip60  interacts with the LRP1 promoter and suppresses its transcription.

The present review aimed to depict the impact of this pandemic and the lockdown on the livestock and poultry sectors in the country, which has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in recent years. Inadequacy of country-wide information has been a major bottleneck for having a thorough understanding of the impact of the prolonged lockdown on different sub-sectors of livestock and poultry. In the present case, an in-depth analysis of the subject has been made through the collation of available published materials and information collected through public contacts. The pandemic and the associated lockdown has not only caused enormous distress to the millions of poor and marginal farmers for saving their crops and/or livestock and thereby assuring their livelihoods but also impacted the overall poultry, dairy, and other livestock production systems and associated value chains, nutrition and health care, and labor availability. The paper highlights various dimensions of the impacts, namely, reduction in demand of different commodities, wastage of the produce due to the closure of transport and market chains, distress sale of the produce, and labor shortage and revival strategies taken by the government and associated enterprises. The present impact study although gives a picture about the overall present scenario, a systematic study through the collection of primary data from all over the country is suggested, which will provide a holistic view of the impact on each of the sub-sectors and the associated value chains.Copyright Â© Biswal, et al.

Progression of NFT pathology is closely correlated with both increased neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD (3) and other tauopathies  such as frontotemporal dementia (4  5). The assumption that mislocalization of tau into the somatodendritic compartment (6) and accumulation of fibrillar aggregates in NFTs mediates neurodegeneration underlies most current therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing NFT formation or disrupting existing NFTs (7  8). Although several disease-associated mutations cause both aggregation of tau and neurodegeneration  whether NFTs per se contribute to neuronal and network dysfunction in vivo is unknown (9). Here we used awake in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor neuronal function in adult rTg4510 mice that overexpress a human mutant form of tau (P301L) and develop cortical NFTs by the age of 7-8 mo (10). Unexpectedly  NFT-bearing neurons in the visual cortex appeared to be completely functionally intact  to be capable of integrating dendritic inputs and effectively encoding orientation and direction selectivity  and to have a stable baseline resting calcium level. These results suggest a reevaluation of the common assumption that insoluble tau aggregates are sufficient to disrupt neuronal function.\",\n",

METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated clinical and X-ray features in all patients referred to the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1st and March 13th. A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25 % to 75-100 %) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (<= 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (<= 50 and > 50 years old). RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8 %). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57 % (95 % CI=47-67) and 89 % (83-94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to <= 5 days (76 % [62-87] vs 37 % [24-52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to <= 50 years (59 % [48-69] vs 47 % [23-72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68 % [45-86] and 82 % [73-89], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall chest X-ray sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 57 %.

However, its impact on stress and subsequent professional pathways is not well understood. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being, training, and career choices of Canadian medical clerks within the first three months of the pandemic. It also aims to assess their use of university support systems and their appreciation of potential solutions to common academic stressors. An electronic survey composed of four sections: demographics, stressors experienced during the pandemic, World Health Organization (WHO) well-being index, and stress management and resources was distributed to Canadian clerks. Clerks from 10 of the 17 Canadian medical faculties participated in this study (nâ€‰=â€‰627). Forty-five percent of clerks reported higher levels of stress than usual; 22% reconsidered their residency choice; and 19% reconsidered medicine as a career. The factors that were most stressful among clerks were: the means of return to rotations; decreased opportunities to be productive in view of residency match; and taking the national licensing exam after the beginning of residency. The mean WHO well-being index was 14.8/25â€‰Â±â€‰4.5, indicating a poor level of well-being among a considerable proportion of students. Clerks who reconsidered their residency choice or medicine as a career had lower mean WHO well-being indices. Most clerks agreed with the following suggested solutions: training sessions on the clinical management of COVID-19 cases; being allowed to submit fewer reference letters when applying to residency; and having protected time to study for their licensing exam during residency. Overall, clerks were less concerned with being infected during their rotations than with the impact of the pandemic on their future career and residency match. The COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable impact on the medical curriculum and well-being of clerks. A number of student-identified solutions were proposed to reduce stress. The implementation of these solutions throughout the Canadian medical training system should be considered.',\n",

BACE1 gene has a tissue-specific expression pattern and its expression is tightly regulated at transcriptional level. Core promoter is a minimal DNA sequence to direct transcription initiation and serves as a converging platform for the vast network of regulatory events. Here we identified the core promoter of human BACE1 gene  which is a 71 nucleotides region absent of typical known core promoter elements and is sufficient to initiate a basal transcription. Two novel DNA motifs  designated TCE1 and TCE2  were found to be involved in activating the transcription of human BACE1 gene in a synergistic way. Two single nucleotide mutations in these motifs completely abolished the promoter activity. In conclusion  our studies have demonstrated that novel DNA motif TCE1 and TCE2 in human BACE1 gene promoter are two essential cis-acting elements for BACE1 gene transcription. Studies on how these two motifs being regulated by different stimuli could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and pharmaceutical potentials of targeting these motifs for AD treatment.\",\n",

There is growing evidence that cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains are involved in regulating trafficking and processing of APP. BACE1  the major beta-secretase in neurons is a palmitoylated transmembrane protein that resides in lipid rafts. A subset of APP is subject to amyloidogenic processing by BACE1 in lipid rafts  and this process depends on the integrity of lipid rafts. Here we describe the association of all four components of the gamma-secretase complex  namely presenilin 1 (PS1)-derived fragments  mature nicastrin  APH-1  and PEN-2  with cholesterol-rich detergent insoluble membrane (DIM) domains of non-neuronal cells and neurons that fulfill the criteria of lipid rafts. In PS1(-/-)/PS2(-/-) and NCT(-/-) fibroblasts  gamma-secretase components that still remain fail to become detergent-resistant  suggesting that raft association requires gamma-secretase complex assembly. Biochemical evidence shows that subunits of the gamma-secretase complex and three TGN/endosome-resident SNAREs cofractionate in sucrose density gradients  and show similar solubility or insolubility characteristics in distinct non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents  indicative of their co-residence in membrane microdomains with similar protein-lipid composition. This notion is confirmed using magnetic immunoisolation of PS1- or syntaxin 6-positive membrane patches from a mixture of membranes with similar buoyant densities following Lubrol WX extraction or sonication  and gradient centrifugation. These findings are consistent with the localization of gamma-secretase in lipid raft microdomains of post-Golgi and endosomes  organelles previously implicated in amyloidogenic processing of APP.\",\n",

North-West and North-East regions showed one week lag, with higher mortality from the beginning of March and 6,942 (6,142 to 7,667) and 8,033 (7,061 to 9,044) total excess deaths respectively. We observed marked geographical differences also at municipality level. For males, the city of Bergamo (Lombardia) showed the largest percent excess, 88.9% (81.9% to 95.2%), at the peak of the pandemic. An excess of 84.2% (73.8% to 93.4%) was also estimated at the same time for males in the city of Pesaro (Central Italy), in stark contrast with the rest of the region, which does not show evidence of excess deaths. We provided a fully probabilistic analysis of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic at sub-national level, suggesting a differential direct and indirect effect in space and time. Our model can be used to help policy-makers target measures locally to contain the burden on the health-care system as well as reducing social and economic consequences. Additionally, this framework can be used for real-time mortality surveillance, continuous monitoring of local temporal trends and to flag where and when mortality rates deviate from the expected range, which might suggest a second wave of the pandemic.',\n",

Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. RESULTS: At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480-747) vs. 455 (352.5-588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels >400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group. The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0-834.0) vs. 567 (472.5-644.50); p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.',\n",

The present study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the CSF biomarker concentrations obtained with a multi-analyte Luminex assay (INNO-BIA AlzBio3) in comparison to single-analyte ELISA tests (INNOTEST). Data from 66 pathologically-confirmed dementia patients (51 AD and 15 non-AD) and 95 controls were included. Cut-off values were determined for each individual biomarker determined using both methods for different diagnostic challenges (dementia-controls; AD-controls; AD-non-AD). Comparing the diagnostic accuracy of individual cut-off values between INNO-BIA and INNOTEST  no relevant differences could be identified. Logistic regression was used in addition to identify the best combination of predictor variables (biomarkers). Discrimination of dementia patients from controls using Aﾎｲ(1-42) and T-tau yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 0.87 and 0.90 for INNO-BIA and INNOTEST  respectively. Discriminating AD patients from controls  the diagnostic accuracy was 0.90 and 0.93 for INNO-BIA and INNOTEST  respectively. Optimal discrimination of AD and non-AD patients was achieved by combining Aﾎｲ(1-42) and P-tau(181P) (diagnostic accuracy = 0.86). In conclusion  which AD biomarkers or combination thereof are most informative is dependent on the differential diagnosis  but the clinical value of these markers in each of the differential diagnoses is independent of the method by which concentrations are determined. Since the clinical value of the ELISA (INNOTEST) and Luminex (INNO-BIA) tests is comparable  further research to select the most suitable analytical platform for routine CSF biomarker measurements is needed.\",\n",

To explore the impacts of the input population and quarantine strategies on the disease variations at different scenarios, four time points were assumed as Feb 6, Feb 16, Feb 24 and Mar 5 2020. The major results suggest that our model can well capture the disease variations with high accuracy. The simulated peak value of the confirmed cases is 1002 at Feb 10, 2020 which is mostly close to the reported number of 1007 at Feb 9, 2020. The disease will become extinction with peak value of 1397 at May 11, 2020. Moreover, the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Increasing the input population and decreasing the quarantine strategy together around the time point of the peak value of the confirmed cases, may lead to the second outbreak.

However  whether the selection of a specific frequency band could impact the topological properties is still not clear. Our hypothesis is that the topological properties of AD patients are also frequency-specific. METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 10 right-handed moderate AD patients (mean age: 64.3 years; mean mini mental state examination [MMSE]: 18.0) and 10 age and gender-matched healthy controls (mean age: 63.6 years; mean MMSE: 28.2) were enrolled in this study. The global efficiency  the clustering coefficient (CC)  the characteristic path length (CpL)  and \"small-world\" property were calculated in a wide range of thresholds and averaged within each group  at three different frequency bands (0.01-0.06 Hz  0.06-0.11 Hz  and 0.11-0.25 Hz). RESULTS: At lower-frequency bands (0.01-0.06 Hz  0.06-0.11 Hz)  the global efficiency  the CC and the \"small-world\" properties of AD patients decreased compared to controls. While at higher-frequency bands (0.11-0.25 Hz)  the CpL was much longer  and the \"small-world\" property was disrupted in AD  particularly at a higher threshold. The topological properties changed with different frequency bands  suggesting the existence of disrupted global and local functional organization associated with AD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the topological alterations of large-scale functional brain networks in AD patients are frequency dependent  thus providing fundamental support for optimal frequency selection in future related research.',\n",

This study aimed to classify the subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in late-life major depressive disorder in remission and to examine their clinical correlates and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. METHODS: Elderly patients with major depressive disorder in remission and elderly comparisons were examined by a comprehensive battery of cognitive tasks. Proposed diagnostic criteria were used for MCI classification  and the degree of brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensity on MRI were evaluated. RESULTS: We found information-processing speed and memory were independent cognitive domains associated with late-life remitted major depressive disorder. Of the study cohort  52.3% met the definition of MCI  including 28.5% with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 23.8% with nonamnestic MCI (naMCI). A clinical correlate of aMCI was the late-onset of disorder (OR = 4.76; 95% CI = 1.57  14.40) and of naMCI was a higher score on the Framingham stroke risk scale (OR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.12  1.72). The odds ratio of highest quartile of ventricular atrophy for aMCI compared to the comparisons was 3.65 (95% CI = 1.22  10.96). CONCLUSIONS: The central cognitive impairments among the elderly with major depressive disorder in remission were memory and information-processing speed  and over half of the subjects met the MCI diagnostic criteria. Different risk factors existed for the subtypes of aMCI and naMCI. Later-age onset of first episode and ventricular atrophy were associated with aMCI  whereas vascular risk factor were associated with naMCI.

We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19. The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19. Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. According to the available evidence, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.Copyright Â© 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Otorrinolaringologia y Cirugia de Cabeza y Cuello',\n",

Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. METHODS: In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Liege University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.',\n",

Many health care systems are balancing resources to manage the current COVID-19 pandemic resulting in surgical delay in patients with large renal masses. METHODS: Using Cox proportional hazard models, we analyzed data from the National Cancer Database for patients undergoing extirpative surgery for clinical T2N0M0 renal masses between 2004 and 2015. Study outcomes were to assess for an association between surgical delay with overall survival and pathologic stage. RESULTS: We identified 11,848 patients who underwent extirpative surgery for clinical T2 renal masses. Compared with patients undergoing surgery within 2 months of diagnosis, we found worse OS for patients with a surgical delay of 3-4 months (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.25) or 5-6 months (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.91). Considering only healthy patients with CCI=0, worse OS was associated with surgical delay of 5-6 months (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.21-2.34, p=0.002) but not 3-4 months (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.26, p=0.309). Pathologic stage (pT or pN) was not associated with surgical delay. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged surgical delay (5-6 months) for patients with T2 renal tumors appears to have a negative impact on OS while shorter surgical delay (3-4 months) was not associated with worse OS in healthy patients. The data presented in this study may help patients and providers to weigh the risk of surgical delay vs. the risk of iatrogenic SARS-CoV-2 exposure during resurgent waves COVID-19 pandemic.

After a 3 hr incubation with labeled drug  the anoxic/oxic binding ratios ranged from 12 to 27 for the four cell types. Retention of [H-3]fluoromisonidazole 4 hr after injection was greater in large KHT tumors (400-600 mm3) with an estimated hypoxic fraction > 30%  than in smaller tumors (50-200 mm3) with an estimated hypoxic fraction of 7-12%. RIF-1 tumors  with an estimated hypoxic fraction of 1.5%  retained the least label  with tumor:blood ratios ranging from 1.7 to 1.9. Spontaneous dog osteosarcomas were imaged with a time of flight positron emission tomograph for up to 5 hr following injection of [F-18]fluoromisonidazole. Analysis of regions of interest in images allowed creation of dynamic tissue time activity curves and calculation of tissue uptake in cpm/gram. These values were compared to radioactivity in plasma. In all cases  retention in some tumor regions exceeded that in plasma and in normal tissue  such as muscle or brain  by 3 to 5 hr post injection. Uptake of fluoromisonidazole in tumors was heterogeneous  with ratios of maximum to minimum uptake as high as 4 in different regions of interest in the same tumor. Tumor:plasma values ranged from 0.28 to 2.02. The oxygen dependency of fluoromisonidazole retention was similar in a variety of cell types and was 50% inhibited by O2 levels in the transition between full radiobiological hypoxia and partial sensitization. The quantitative regional imaging of [F-18]fluoromisonidazole in spontaneous canine tumors at varying times post-injection lays the basis for imaging and modeling of oxygen-dependent drug retention in different regions of human neoplasms',\n",

The aim of this study was to describe the impact of these measures on the number of hospitalizations in Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units, with the hypothesis that the social behavior generated by this emergency promotes a decreased demand for medical care, even when severe cardiovascular disease is involved. We compared the number of admissions in March-April 2010-2019 versus March-April 2020, based on a prospective study including six institutions (three public and three private) that use Epi-Cardio as a multicenter registry of cardiovascular care unit discharge. Altogether, we included 6839 patients discharged during the 11-year study period (2010-2020). The average number of patient admissions on March-April 2010-19 was 595 (CI 95%: 507-683) and decreased to 348 in 2020 (fall of 46.8%, p < 0.001).

In the present study  we observed the activation states of IGF-1 downstream signaling in brain slices of transgenic mice carrying APPswe/PS1dE9 mutations (APP/PS1 mice) at both early and late stages (ex vivo) and further investigated the involvement of oligomeric ﾎｲ-amyloid (Aﾎｲ) and Aﾎｲ-enriched culture medium (CM) on IGF-1 sensitivity employing neuronal models (in vitro). In 6- and 18-month-old APP/PS1 mice  the phosphorylations of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and Akt in response to IGF-1 stimulation were significantly reduced in the hippocampal and cortical slices  whereas IGF-1R protein expression and mRNA levels of IGF-1 and IGF-1R in the hippocampal slices were significantly higher than that in wild-type mice. In agreement with these results  reduced IGF-1 sensitivity was verified in APP and PS1 double stably transfected CHO cells; moreover  IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylations of IGF-1R and Akt were also markedly weakened by oligomeric Aﾎｲ or Aﾎｲ-enriched CM posttreatment in CHO cells without APP/PS1-transfected (K1 cells) and primary hippocampal neurons. These observations indicate that the impaired central IGF-1 sensitivity at early and late stages of APP/PS1 transgenic mice might be attributable  at least partially  to the overproduced Aﾎｲ  especially the oligomeric Aﾎｲ. These findings may shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the defective IGF-1 signaling in AD pathogenesis and provide important clues for AD drug discovery.\",\n",

RESULTS: With an incidence of 3%(1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9%(55/138)-50.2%(101/201), diarrhoea 2%(2/99)-49.5%(146/295), vomiting 3.6%(5/138)-66.7%(4/6), nausea 1%(1/99)-29.4%(59/201), abdominal pain 2.2%(3/138)-6.0%(12/201), and gastrointestinal bleeding 4%(2/52)-13.7%(10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 +/- 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. 3.6%(5/138)-15.9%(32/201) of adult patients presented vomiting and 6.5%(2/31)-66.7%(4/6) of children. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in non-severe patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms were similar in severe and non-severe cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). ACE2 receptor and virus nucleocapsid protein was detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. About 36%(5/14)-53%(39/73) faecal PCR becomes positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23%(17/73)-82%(54/66) patients for 1-11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic.

Our aim is to characterize acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients admitted to a medical critical care unit (MCCU) in a referral hospital in Spain. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of consecutive ARDS COVID-19 patients admitted and treated in our MCCU. SETTING: 36-bed MCCU in referral tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal/pharyngeal swabs. INTERVENTIONS: None MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. RESULTS: Forty-four ARDS COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Median age was 61.50 (53.25 - 67) years and most of the patients were male (72.7%). Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent co-morbidities (52.3 and 36.4% respectively). Steroids (1mg/Kg/day) and tocilizumab were administered in almost all patients (95.5%). 77.3% of the patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 16 days [11-28]. Prone position ventilation was performed in 33 patients (97%) for a median of 3 sessions [2-5] per patient. Nosocomial infection was diagnosed in 13 patients (29.5%). Tracheostomy was performed in ten patients (29.4%). At study closing all patients had been discharged from the CCU and only two (4.5%) remained in hospital ward. MCCU length of stay was 18 days [10-27]. Mortality at study closing was 20.5% (n 9); 26.5% among ventilated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The seven-week period in which our MCCU was exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients has been challenging. Despite the severity of the patients and the high need for invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality was 20.5%. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC. All rights reserved.',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"Semantic knowledge for famous names in mild cognitive impairment.Person identification represents a unique category of semantic knowledge that is commonly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD)  but has received relatively little investigation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The current study examined the retrieval of semantic knowledge for famous names from three time epochs (recent  remote  and enduring) in two participant groups: 23 amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients and 23 healthy elderly controls. The aMCI group was less accurate and produced less semantic knowledge than controls for famous names. Names from the enduring period were recognized faster than both recent and remote names in both groups  and remote names were recognized more quickly than recent names. Episodic memory performance was correlated with greater semantic knowledge particularly for recent names. We suggest that the anterograde memory deficits in the aMCI group interferes with learning of recent famous names and as a result produces difficulties with updating and integrating new semantic information with previously stored information. The implications of these findings for characterizing semantic memory deficits in MCI are discussed. (JINS  2009  15  9-18.).\",\n",

Current treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia has been modeled from currently established guidelines such as that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 pneumonia, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by severe hypoxia and near-normal respiratory system compliance with a time-related presentation. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 receptor agonist that promotes sedative and anxiolytic effects without the risk of respiratory depression and can provide cooperative or semi-rousable sedation. Patients who are developing ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia have been treated with self-proning intervals in combination with supplementation of oxygenation via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV); however, a few patients have poor tolerance to the devices, leading to poor compliance and eventual worsening respiratory symptoms leading to intubation. In the current case report, we detail how a patient was able to successfully be self-proned with proper tolerance to HFNC and NIPPV while using dexmedetomidine, leading to discharge without the need for further oxygen supplementation at home.

In immunocompromised adults  neonates  and people exposed to reptiles  Salmonella enterica spp. arizonae  one of the non-thyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) can cause sepsis and bacteremia. Rarely  patients may develop meningitis with high risk for seizures  hydrocephalus  sensorineural hearing loss  and death. Immediate recognition and initiation of treatment is critical. Case presentation We present an 18-day-old male with a one day history of fever  irritability  and decreased oral intake. He was taken to the local emergency department and was admitted after initial sepsis evaluation. His initial work-up was concerning for meningitis and was empirically started on intravenous (IV) acyclovir  ampicillin  gentamicin  and cefepime. He was transferred to our institution where further history revealed exposure to pet snakes at the aunt's house where the infant and his family were staying. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was later reported to grow gramnegative rods (GNR). Acyclovir was discontinued since the (GNR) in blood and CSF cultures was confirmed to be Salmonella enterica spp. arizonae. He was treated with ceftazidime at meningitic doses since the isolate was reported to be sensitive and cefotaxime was not available at our institution. Two days after treatment  his symptoms started to improve and repeat blood cultures remained negative. He received total 4 weeks of IV antibiotics. End of therapy CSF parameters  head imaging and hearing screening were within normal limits per age. He had normal physical examination at discharge. Conclusion Non-typhoidal Salmonella meningitis should be on the differential diagnosis in neonates  the immunocompromised  and individuals who were exposed to reptiles who present with signs and symptoms of bacterial meningitis. Although very rare  failure to identify and treat in a timely manner can result in a very poor prognosis.\",\n",

Materials and Methods: The women diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized at a tertiary hospital were included. They completed the Introductory Data Form, the Female Sexual Function Index-(FSFI), and the Short Form-36 Quality of Life Scale (SF-36). Results: 15 women between the ages of 19-49 who completed the treatment protocol, discharged at least 14 days before, and who had not been diagnosed as sexual dysfunction sexually active earlier were included to the study. It was detected that weekly sexual intercourse before and after COVID-19 significantly differed (p=0.047). The frequency of relationships decreased statistically after COVID-19. The mean value of the FSFI satisfaction score differs from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p=0.012). The mean satisfaction score before COVID-19 was 3.47, and after COVID-19 was 2.93. The score of the subgroups of FSFI did not differ from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p>0.050). The median value of SF-36 pain differs from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p=0.008).

Objective measurement of disease severity is of increasing importance for detecting symptomatic disease  as well as monitoring disease progression and the response to novel therapeutic interventions. Using a newly-developed infra-red scleral oculometer  we measured saccadic latencies and durations in HD patients exhibiting a broad range of symptoms (n=24) and control subjects of comparable ages (n=20) to see whether these parameters might reflect the presence or severity of HD. Latency distributions were characterised by creating reciprobit plots for each subject  whilst parametric statistics were applied to durations. Compared with the control group  we found the HD group had a significantly increased median latency  and early saccades were more prominent. In addition  HD patients exhibited an increased saccadic duration and variability of duration. Using Bayesian (likelihood) analysis  we obtained saccadic support values for the presence of clinical HD  which correlated with the motor Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score in these patients. A sensitivity/specificity analysis of all 44 participants showed that the use of this multivariate support measure was highly successful in predicting HD status  correctly diagnosing 75% of the HD patients  and (95%) of the controls; with a different criterion  these figures were 96 and 15%. Furthermore  we correctly predicted absence of disease in two additional subjects subsequently confirmed to be genetically unaffected. This strongly suggests that multivariate support values derived from saccadic parameters may provide an objective  quantitative biomarker of HD  especially the degree of motor impairment. However  larger longitudinal studies are required to determine whether they can reliably detect the earliest presymptomatic disease  or faithfully reflect disease progression.\",\n",

Most patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis  memory deficits  seizures  and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements  and autonomic and breathing instability. The disorder predominantly affects children and young adults  occurs with or without tumour association  and responds to treatment but can relapse. The presence of a tumour (usually an ovarian teratoma) is dependent on age  sex  and ethnicity  being more frequent in women older than 18 years  and slightly more predominant in black women than it is in white women. Patients treated with tumour resection and immunotherapy (corticosteroids  intravenous immunoglobulin  or plasma exchange) respond faster to treatment and less frequently need second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide or rituximab  or both) than do patients without a tumour who receive similar initial immunotherapy. More than 75% of all patients have substantial recovery that occurs in inverse order of symptom development and is associated with a decline of antibody titres. Patients' antibodies cause a titre-dependent  reversible decrease of synaptic NMDAR by a mechanism of crosslinking and internalisation.

Secondary data for daily meteorological variables and COVID-19 cases from March 8 to May 31, 2020, were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). Distributed lag nonlinear models, Pearson's correlation coefficient and wavelet transform coherence were employed to appraise the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases. Significant coherence between meteorological variables and COVID-19 at various time-frequency bands has been identified in this work. The results showed that the minimum (MinT) and mean temperature, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH) and absolute humidity (AH) had a significant positive correlation while contact transmission had no direct association with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. When the MinT was 18 degreeC, the relative risk (RR) was the highest as 1.04 (95%CI 1.01-1.06) at lag day 11. For the WS, the highest RR was 1.03 (95% CI 1.00-1.07) at lag day 0, when the WS was 21 km/h. When RH was 46%, the highest RR was 1.00 (95% CI 0.98-1.01) at lag day 14. When AH was 23 g/m3, the highest RR was 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) at lag day 14. We found a profound effect of meteorological factors on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These results will assist policymakers to know the behavioral pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus against meteorological indicators and thus assist to devise an effective policy to fight against COVID-19 in Bangladesh.

A case-control study of clinical progression and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.BACKGROUND: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is generally thought to have a more rapid course compared to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The faster progression of EOAD observed in some studies has also been thought to correlate with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Our clinical experience has not been suggestive of any difference in disease progression; therefore  we decided to investigate whether differences in clinical progression and CSF biomarkers between EOAD and LOAD could be demonstrated. METHODS: Case-control study with 42 patients  21 EOAD and 21 matched LOAD patients. Rates of progression were calculated and these  as well as CSF biomarker levels  were statistically compared. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in clinical progression between the EOAD group and the LOAD group. There was no significant difference in the absolute values of CSF biomarkers  but a tendency towards lower levels of ﾎｲ-amyloid in patients with EOAD was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not converge with results from the majority of previous studies  which have been suggestive of a faster clinical progression in EOAD. Possibly  the very strict algorithm by which our patients were matched explains our findings. However  the findings should be repeated in a larger study population.\",\n",

The healthcare industry has been a relatively slow adopter of digital innovation due to the conventional belief that humans need to be at the center of healthcare delivery tasks. However, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to carry out specific tasks such as pre-hospital triage and enable clinicians to deliver care at scale. Recognizing that the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild and do not require hospitalization, Partners HealthCare (now Mass General Brigham) implemented a digitally-automated pre-hospital triage solution to direct patients to the appropriate care setting before they showed up at the emergency department and clinics, which would otherwise consume resources, expose other patients and staff to potential viral transmission, and further exacerbate supply-and-demand mismatching. Although the use of AI has been well-established in other industries to optimize supply and demand matching, the introduction of AI to perform tasks remotely that were traditionally performed in-person by clinical staff represents a significant milestone in healthcare operations strategy.',\n",

Older adults and patients with comorbidities and immunosuppressive conditions may experience severe signs and symptoms that can lead to death. This case series assesses the clinical course, imaging features, and outcomes for 12 patients with COVID-19 and a history of kidney transplantation. Patients were evaluated for symptoms, laboratory data, imaging findings, and outcomes from February 2020 to April 2020. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms, noted in 75% (nine/12), 75% (nine/12), and 41.7% (five/12) of the patients, respectively. Most of the patients had a normal white blood cell count, while 33.3% (four/12) had leukopenia and 8.3% (one/12) had leukocytosis. A combination of consolidation and ground glass opacity was the most predominant (75%) pattern of lung involvement on computed tomography (CT). Eight patients died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and four were discharged. All recovered cases had a unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement limited to only one zone on initial chest CT. It seems that CT imaging has an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients. Future studies with long-term follow up and more cases are needed to elucidate COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome, and management strategies for these patients. Copyright Â© 2020.

Very few studies have reported association between obesity and severity of COVID-19. In this meta-analysis, we assessed the association of obesity and outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. METHODS: Data from observational studies describing the obesity or body mass index (BMI) and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019, to August 15, 2020, was extracted following PRISMA guidelines with a consensus of two independent reviewers. Adverse outcomes defined as intensive care units (ICU), oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), severe disease and in-hospital mortality. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies with 10,233 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The overall prevalence of obesity in our study was 33.9% (3473/10,233). In meta-analysis, COVID-19 patient with obesity had higher odds of poor outcomes compared to better outcomes with a pooled OR of 1.88 (95%CI:1.25-2.80; p=0.002), with 86% heterogeneity between studies (p<0.00001).

Method(s): Serum N protein level in SARS-COV-2 infected patients and non-SARS-COV-2 infected population was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) double antibody sandwich assay. Colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was used to detect serum N protein antibodies in the above populations. Result(s): Fifty cases of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-positive and SARS-CoV-2 antibody-negative patients had a serum N protein positivity rate of 76%. Thirty-seven patients who were positive for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody after infection had a serum SARS-CoV-2 N protein positivity rate of 2.7%. Serum N protein test results of 633 non-SARS-COV-2 infected patients, including pregnant women, patients with other respiratory infections, and individuals with increased rheumatoid factor were all negative, with serum N protein concentration <10.00 pg/mL at 100% specificity. Using SPSS 19.0 to calculate the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve was determined to be 0.9756 (95% confidence interval 0.9485-1.000, p < 0.0001), and sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% confidence interval 81.16-96.85%) and 96.84% (95% confidence interval 95.17-97.15%), respectively. The best CUT-OFF value was 1.850 pg/mL. Conclusion(s): The measurement of serum SARS-COV-2 N protein has a high diagnostic value for infected patients before the antibody appears and shortens the window period of serological diagnosis.

In this study, we assessed the perception and practices regarding COVID-19 among residents in selected urban communities of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design using a multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit 360 respondents (Mean age: 33.2 +/- 10.6 years; 62.5% females) from households in Ibadan. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire from 3rd to 6th June 2020. Those who demonstrated washing of the palm, back of the hand, spaces between the fingers, fingernails, wrist, and thumbs had six points and were categorized to have had a good practice of handwashing. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Bivariate analyses of sociodemographic characteristics and good handwashing practices were conducted using Chi-square test. Logistic regression was conducted to identify the determinants of good handwashing practices. P-values < 0.05 were statistically significant. Results: Going to the hospital (95%) and calling the COVID-19 help number (58.3%) were the frequently reported practices among respondents following the development of COVID-19 symptoms. Also, 89 (26%) knew they could contract COVID-19, while 41 (12%) perceived it as an exaggerated event. The effects most frequently reported by respondents were hunger/low income (48.8%) and academic delay (8.8%). Use of face masks by 64.5% and social distancing (48%) were the most frequently reported practices for prevention. Only 71 (20.8%) demonstrated good handwashing practices. The perception of the likelihood to contract COVID-19 and practices to prevent COVID-19 had a weak correlation of 0.239 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Gaps exist in the practices that prevent COVID-19. There is a need to improve handwashing, use of face masks and other practices that prevent COVID-19. Implications across public health communication and policies were stated.

Information regarding prevalence and risk factors for adverse outcomes in HCWs is scarce in Mexico. Here, we aimed to explore prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. All cases underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored outcomes related to severe COVID-19 in HCWs and the diagnostic performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs. RESULTS: As of July 5 th, 2020, 35,095 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 11,226 were confirmed (31.9%). Overall, 4,322 were nurses (38.5%), 3,324 physicians (29.6%), 131 dentists (1.16%) and 3,449 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (30.8%). After follow-up, 1,009 HCWs required hospitalization (9.00%), 203 developed severe outcomes (1.81%), and 93 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.82%). Lethality was recorded in 226 (2.01%) cases. Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever, cough, malaise, shivering, myalgias at evaluation but neither had significant predictive value. We also identified 341 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.04%). Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases, pregnancy, and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcomes. Physicians had higher risk for hospitalization and for severe outcomes compared with nurses and other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in Mexico City. No symptomatology can accurately discern HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce infection risk.

CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that CR may have operated on the process of recognition through partial restoration of function in frontal brain areas that are less compromised in early-stage AD and that physiological markers may be more sensitive indicators of brain plasticity than behavioral performance.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Copper-dependent inhibition of human cytochrome c oxidase by a dimeric conformer of amyloid-beta1-42.In studies of Alzheimer\\'s disease pathogenesis there is an increasing focus on mechanisms of intracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation and toxicity. Here we investigated the inhibitory potential of the 42 amino acid Abeta peptide (Abeta1-42) on activity of electron transport chain enzyme complexes in human mitochondria. We found that synthetic Abeta1-42 specifically inhibited the terminal complex cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in a dose-dependent manner that was dependent on the presence of Cu2+ and specific \"aging\" of the Abeta1-42 solution. Maximal COX inhibition occurred when using Abeta1-42 solutions aged for 3-6 h at 30 degrees C. The level of Abeta1-42-mediated COX inhibition increased with aging time up to approximately 6 h and then declined progressively with continued aging to 48 h. Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins followed by SDS-PAGE analysis revealed dimeric Abeta as the only Abeta species to provide significant temporal correlation with the observed COX inhibition. Analysis of brain and liver from an Alzheimer\\'s model mouse (Tg2576) revealed abundant Abeta immunoreactivity within the brain mitochondria fraction. Our data indicate that endogenous Abeta is associated with brain mitochondria and that Abeta1-42  possibly in its dimeric conformation  is a potent inhibitor of COX  but only when in the presence of Cu2+. We conclude that Cu2+-dependent Abeta-mediated inhibition of COX may be an important contributor to the neurodegeneration process in Alzheimer\\'s disease.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Immediate psychological distress in quarantined patients with COVID-19 and its association with peripheral inflammation: a mixed-method studySince the end of 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within +/- three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of \"Perceived Helplessness\", the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = .37, P = 0.003, Spearman\\'s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.

METHODS: The study focused on 37 patients who were clinically diagnosed with AD and were examined by both MRI and perfusion SPECT twice during a 1- to 2-year clinical observation period. Twenty-four of the 37 patients showed a progression of cognitive deterioration during the 1.2(ﾂｱ0.4)-year period of clinical observation (rapidly progressing group: initial mean MMSE score = 23.3; second mean MMSE score = 20.2)  while 13 patients showed no apparent progression of cognitive deterioration (slowly progressing group: initial mean MMSE score = 21.2; second mean MMSE score = 22.2). The morphological changes were evaluated using a voxel-based morphometric technique with segmented MRI images. Cerebral perfusion was measured by Tc-99m ECD SPECT. Data analysis was performed by SPM on a MATLAB work space (2007.a). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in either the perfusion or gray matter density between the rapidly progressing and slowly progressing groups at the initial examination. The rapidly progressing group showed an interval decrease of perfusion in the bilateral parieto-occipital cortex and a decrease of gray matter density in the bilateral temporal and cingulate cortex. The slowly progressing group did not show a significant interval change in either the cerebral perfusion or gray matter density. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rapid symptomatic progression in AD patients accompanies rapid progression of both morphological and perfusion changes  although the regions of the changes differ between them.\",\n",

Results: ﾎ派TK2 was successfully expressed in the cytoplasm of transduced cells. A new anti-hTK2 monoclonal antibody 8G2 was developed. The levels of FIAU and FEAU accumulation in cells expressing ﾎ派TK2 and ﾎ派TK2 GFP were at least 10-fold higher than in wild-type cells in vitro and about 6 times higher in vivo. We determined that FEAU is a more specific reporter substrate for ﾎ派TK2 than FIAU  whereas FHBG is not phosphorylated by this enzyme. In addition  we showed that ﾎ派TK2 transduced cells can be eliminated by treatment with D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine. Conclusion: We have tested a human-derived reporter gene that is likely to be non-immunogenic and potentially allows for long-term monitoring of different molecular-genetic processes by nuclear imaging techniques in humans.

OBJECTIVE: To use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of death among ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 123 COVID-19 patients inthe ICU of Vulcan Hill Hospital were selected from the database, and data were randomly divided into a training data set (n = 98) and test data set (n = 25) with a 4:1 ratio. Significance tests, analysis of correlation and factor analysis were used to screen the 100 potential risk factors individually. Conventional logistic regression methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to construct the risk prediction model for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients in ICU. Performance of these machine learning models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Model interpretation and model evaluation of the risk prediction model, such as calibration curve, SHAP, LIME, etc., were performed to ensure its stability and reliability. The outcome is based on the ICU death recorded from the database. RESULTS: Layer-by-layer screening of 100 potential risk factors finallyrevealed 8 important risk factors that were included in the risk prediction model: lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), prothrombin time (PT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin (T-Bil), percentage of eosinophils (EOS%), creatinine(Cr), neutrophil percentage (NEUT%), albumin (ALB) level. Finally, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) established by 8 important risk factors showed the best recognition ability in the training set of 5-fold cross validation (AUC=0.86) and the verification queue (AUC=0.92). The calibration curve showed that the risk predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual risk. In addition, using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithms, feature interpretation and sample prediction interpretation algorithms of the XGBoost black box model were implemented. Additionally, the model has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available for the public usage ( http://114.251.235.51:1226/index). CONCLUSIONS: The 8 factors XGBoost model predicts risk of death in ICU patients with COVID-19 well,which initially demonstrates stability and can be used effectively to predict COVID-19 prognosis in ICU patients.

PS and other gamma-secretase components are well conserved among metazoa  but their presence and function in more-distant species are not resolved. Because inappropriate gamma-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in humans is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease  understanding essential elements within each gamma-secretase component is crucial to functional studies. Diverged proteins have been identified in primitive plants but experiments have failed to demonstrate gamma-secretase activity. We have identified highly diverged orthologs for each gamma-secretase component in the ancient eukaryote Dictyostelium  which lacks equivalents of APP  Notch and other characterized PS/gamma-secretase substrates. We show that wild-type (WT) Dictyostelium is capable of amyloidogenic processing of ectopically expressed human APP to generate amyloid-beta peptides Abeta(40) and Abeta(42); strains deficient in gamma-secretase cannot produce Abeta peptides but accumulate processed intermediates of APP that co-migrate with the C-terminal fragments alpha- and beta-CTF of APP that are found in mammalian cells. We further demonstrate that Dictyostelium requires PS for phagocytosis and cell-fate specification in a cell-autonomous manner  and show that regulation of phagocytosis requires an active gamma-secretase  a pathway suggested  but not proven  to occur in mammalian and Drosophila cells. Our results indicate that PS signaling is an ancient process that arose prior to metazoan radiation  perhaps independently of Notch.

While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, sociodemographic, socioeconomic status, behavior risk factors, and meteorological factors. Results: 1,027,799 COVID-19 cases and 58,489 deaths were reported in 3,122 US counties from January 22, 2020 to April 29, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 5.8%. Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values<0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM2.5 or O3 and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values>0.05), although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.4 ug/m3) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate. Discussions and Conclusions: Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure.

During the 3-month Covid-19 lockdown, low back pain was higher in the SH group than CW group (p < .05). Rates of the neck, upper-back, shoulder, and hip/thigh pain were lower, and rate of low back pain was higher in the SH group (p < .05); while, rates of the neck, upper back, shoulder, and elbow pain were lower in the CW group (p < .05) during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown than pre-lockdown values. The total scores of the C19P-S and psychological, psychosomatic, social, and economic subscales were higher in the SH group (p < .05). Sleep quality was similar in both groups (p > .05).

It affects the cranial branches of the arteries originating from the aortic arch and is usually associated with markedly elevated acute-phase reactants. In 10-15% of cases the extra-cranial branches of the aortic arch are involved. GCA is closely related to polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)  although the relationship between the two disorders is still unclear. New-onset headache  scalp tenderness  jaw claudication  temporal artery abnormalities on physical examination  visual symptoms and associated PMR represent the most typical and frequent features of the disease. Systemic manifestations  including fever  anorexia and weight loss  are observed in 50% of cases. Less frequent manifestations are related to the central or peripheral nervous systems  the respiratory tract and extra-cranial large-vessel involvement. As GCA is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations  it is important to recognize the different onset patterns of the disease and related diagnostic steps. The diagnosis is relatively straightforward in the presence of typical cranial manifestations  but it may be challenging in the case of a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate  occult GCA or in patients with isolated extra-cranial features. Temporal artery biopsy still represents the gold standard for diagnosis  while the role of ultrasonography  high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography should be better addressed. Corticosteroids remain the therapy of choice. Data supporting the usefulness of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants combined with corticosteroids to prevent ischaemic complications as well as the corticosteroid-sparing effect of methotrexate and anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha drugs are limited and non-conclusive.',\n",

METHODS: We sought to monitor deep healing, as indicated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to use this to determine treatment duration. Clinical and MRI fistula healing (at 6, 12, and 18 months), Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Perianal Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire were prospectively assessed.     RESULTS: Thirty-four consecutive patients with perineal fistulas were treated with infliximab (19), adalimumab (7; all infliximab failures) and thalidomide (8). Median follow-up was 110 weeks (range, 74-161). Baseline MRI: 38% >= 2 tracks, 21% anolabial/rectovaginal. At latest follow-up, clinical fistula 'response' and 'closure' were seen in 50 and 46% of antibody-treated patients, respectively. All patients stopped thalidomide early due to side effects. Of 26 antibody-treated patients, at 6 (n = 25), 12 (n = 25), and 18 (n = 20) months, respectively, MRI showed complete healing (20, 28, and 30 %, respectively), improvement (68, 72, and 65 %), no change (12, 0, and 0%) or worsening (0, 0, and 5 %). MRI healing at 6 months (n = 5) persisted at 12 and 18 months, including in two patients who stopped treatment at 6 months. Fistula history length and complexity did not influence the outcome. The only surgical intervention was seton insertion in one patient. The PDAI and CDAI scores decreased, and quality of life improved significantly at last follow-up.     CONCLUSIONS: MRI fistula resolution was variable and slower than clinical healing. Prolonged treatment is often required for internal track resolution. Preliminary data suggest once MRI healing has occurred fistulas remain healed, while remaining on, or stopping anti-TNF alpha therapy. The use of a second antibody is clinically valuable.\",\n",

The current study explored the trajectory of panic and its associated factors to develop promising strategies for controlling the global spread of COVID-19 and improving the mental health emergency management. METHODS: A total of 812 unmarried adults (aged from 18 to 42 years, M = 23.3, SD = 3.45) from all over China participated online in our investigation. A Growth Mixture Model (GMM) was developed and analysed. RESULTS: Three classes of trajectories for panic were identified: the \"continuous decline group (CDG)\", the \"continuous low group (CLG),\" and the \"continuous high group (CHG)\". With reference to the CDG, people in the CHG were more sensitive to social factors. With reference to the CDG, people in the CLG were more likely to possess some of the following traits: being men, in Hubei Province (center of the pandemic), with a lower income, and less sensitive towards social factors and individual factors. With reference to the CLG, people in the CHG were more likely to be women, located outside of Hubei Province, and more sensitive to social factors, family factors, and individual factors. CONCLUSION: Social factors, family factors, and individual factors predicted the different trajectories of panic. Copyright Â© 2020 International Association of Applied Psychology.',\n",

The virus affects the human respiratory and other systems, and presents mostly as acute respiratory syndrome with fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea. The clinical manifestations vary from no symptoms to multiple organ failure. Majority of patients fully recover. Several postinfectious presumably autoimmune complications of COVID-19 affecting the brain or peripheral large nerve fibers have been reported. This report describes a post COVID-19 patient who developed chronic fatigue, orthostatic dizziness and brain fog consistent with orthostatic hypoperfusion syndrome (OCHOS), a form of orthostatic intolerance, and painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Initially, the patient was diagnosed with. OCHOS (detected by the tilt test with transcranial Doppler monitoring) and SFN (confirmed by skin biopsy), and both OCHOS/SFN were attributed to Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome of presumed autoimmune etiology. Patient recovered on symptomatic therapy. COVID-19 triggered exacerbation of OCHOS/SFN responded to immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. This case suggests that post COVID-19 syndrome may present as an autoimmune OCHOS/SFN and that early immunotherapy may be effective. Further studies are necessary to confirm the link between OCHOS/SFN and COVID-19 disease as well as to confirm the benefit of immunotherapy.Copyright Â© 2020',\n",

METHODOLOGY: One hundred and fifty-four young policemen (mean age 27.1 +/-3.8 years) were included in the study after written consent. Squad officers who had any sign of acute respiratory infection were excluded from the study. The participants were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding nature of exposure with the infected cases, kind of personal protective equipment they are provided with and living arrangements. Three ml of blood samples were collected from the participants and immediately sent to the lab for analysis. COVID-19 IgG antibodies were analysed using chemiluminescence immunoassay method on Architect Ci8200 (Abbott). SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: All participants were males and mean age was 27.1 +/-3.8 years. Out of 154 squad members, 24 were reactive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies and performing duties at the areas of high virus exposure. None of COVID-19 IgG reactive cases exhibited symptoms and most of them performed duties at high risk areas with only masks provided as personal protective equipment. Only 10% of the participants who were exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found to have anti-COVID IgG. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 IgG antibody reactive cases may not show any symptoms.

Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. METHODS: The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11-85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. CONCLUSIONS: Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found. Presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined for an appropriate duration which, in our experience, is 2 months. Copyright Â© 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

To prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, governments worldwide have implemented different forms of public health measures ranging from physical distancing recommendations to stay-at-home orders, which have disrupted individuals' everyday life tremendously. However, evidence on the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures with mental health are limited so far. In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health.

Although some of these compounds were neuroprotective against 0.1 microM Abeta  only three protected against the 1-10 microM Abeta-induced toxicity and  in contrast to 22R-hydroxycholesterol  all were devoid of steroidogenic activity. These entities shared a common structural feature  a long chain ester in position 3 and common stereochemistry. The neuroprotective property of these compounds was coupled to their ability to displace radiolabeled 22R-hydroxycholesterol from Abeta  suggesting that the Abeta-22R-hydroxycholesterol physicochemical interaction contributes to their beneficial effect. In addition  a 22R-hydroxycholesterol derivative inhibited the formation of neurotoxic amyloid-derived diffusible ligands. Computational docking simulations of 22R-hydroxycholesterol and its derivatives on Abeta identified two binding sites. Chemical entities  as 22R-hydroxycholesterol  seem to bind preferentially only to one site. In contrast  the presence of the ester chain seems to confer the ability to bind to both sites on Abeta  leading to neuroprotection against high concentrations of Abeta.

Methods to compute brain change must be robust to scan quality. Biases may arise if any scans are thrown out  as this can lead to the true changes being overestimated or underestimated. Here we analyzed the full MRI dataset from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) and assessed several sources of bias that can arise when tracking brain changes with structural brain imaging methods  as part of a pipeline for tensor-based morphometry (TBM). In all healthy subjects who completed MRI scanning at screening  6  12  and 24months  brain atrophy was essentially linear with no detectable bias in longitudinal measures. In power analyses for clinical trials based on these change measures  only 39AD patients and 95 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects were needed for a 24-month trial to detect a 25% reduction in the average rate of change using a two-sided test (ﾎｱ=0.05  power=80%).

Some states have taken actions to mitigate shortages of PPE and staffing in nursing homes, including creating dedicated long-term care (LTC) teams and supporting staffing capacity. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether state actions and nursing home characteristics are associated with shortages of PPE and staffing. DESIGN AND SETTING: Facility-level data released July 31st , 2020 from the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File was combined with data from other sources. Our sample was the 13,445 facilities with information about PPE and staffing shortages for each of the five weeks between the week ending June 21st , 2020 and the week ending July 19th , 2020. Associations between facility characteristics and shortages were examined using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome variables were whether or not a facility lacked a one-week supply of PPE (\"PPE shortage\") and whether or not a facility had a staffing shortage during one or more weeks over the five-week study period. RESULTS: Over the five-week study period, 27.6% of facilities reported one or more weeks of PPE shortage, 30.2% of facilities reported at least one week of staffing shortage, and 46.5% of facilities lacked PPE and/or staff. Facilities located in states in the Northeastern PPE consortium or with LTC teams were modestly less likely to have had a PPE shortage and facilities located in states that implemented processes to match job seekers with LTC facilities were marginally significantly less likely to have had a staffing shortage. CONCLUSION: Given that nearly half of U.S. nursing homes recently faced a shortage of PPE and/or staff, and that state budget deficits may limit further state actions, ongoing federal assistance with PPE and staffing of nursing homes is needed.

In this descriptive study, RMD patients who were treated with rituximab in the last 12 months at the Rheumatology Department of our hospital were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection via telephone interview and a comprehensive review of clinical health records (01/02/2020-26/05/2020). Those with probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. In total, 76 patients were screened. Of these, 13 (17.1%) had suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. With regard to these 13 patients, the median age at coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis was 68 years (range 28-76 years) and 8 (61.5%) were female. Five patients had rheumatoid arthritis, three had systemic vasculitis, two had Sjogren syndrome, and two had systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, seven patients (53.8%) had pulmonary involvement secondary to RMD. Eight patients (61.5%) developed severe disease leading to hospitalization, and seven developed bilateral pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency. Of the eight hospitalized patients, five (62.5%) fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria and three developed a critical disease and died. Our cohort had a high rate of severe disease requiring hospitalization (61.5%), with bilateral pneumonia and hyperinflammation leading to a high mortality rate (23.1%). Treatment with rituximab should be considered a possible risk factor for unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients with RMD. However, further study is required to confirm this association.',\n",

We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with COVID-19 or SARS. Study Design and Setting: We extracted the data from: (1) a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, (2) a public data set of the first 37 cases of patients who died of COVID-19 and 1,019 patients who survived in China, and (3) data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing in early 2003. Results: Older age and a high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. Age was comparable between men and women in all data sets. In the case series, however, men's cases tended to be more serious than women's (P = 0.035). In the public data set, the number of men who died from COVID-19 is 2.4 times that of women (70.3 vs. 29.7%, P = 0.016). In SARS patients, the gender role in mortality was also observed. The percentage of males were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (P = 0.015). Conclusion: While men and women have the same prevalence, men with COVID-19 are more at risk for worse outcomes and death, independent of age.

The lack of availability of approved treatment for this disease calls forth the scientific community to find novel compounds with the ability to treat it. This paper evaluates the compound Andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata as a potential inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-COV-2 (Mpro) through in silico studies such as molecular docking, target analysis, toxicity prediction and ADME prediction. Andrographolide was docked successfully in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

       "  {'feature': 'The Effect of Corona Virus Lockdown on Air Pollution: Evidence from the City of Brescia in Lombardia Region (Italy)After the outbreak of Corona virus pandemic in Italy, the government has taken extraordinary measures, including a national lockdown, to prevent the spread of the infection. This extraordinary situation has led to a reduction in air pollution levels measured in the whole Po Valley, usually known as one of the most polluted areas in Europe in terms of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the lockdown on the air quality improvement. In particular, an interrupted time series modelling approach is employed to test if a significant change in the level and the trend of the pollutant time series has occurred after the lockdown measure. The case study regards the city of Brescia (Northern Italy) and focuses on the comparison of the period before (January 1st-March 7th, 2020) and after (March 8th-March 27th, 2020) the lockdown. By adjusting for meteorology and Sunday effect, the results show that a significant change in air quality occurring in the post intervention period was observed only for a single NO2 station located in a heavy traffic zone. In particular, the estimate of the time series slope, i.e. the expected change in the concentration associated with a time unit increase, decreases from -0.25 to -1.67 after the lockdown. For the remaining stations, no significant change was found in the concentration time series when comparing the two periods. This confirms the complexity of air pollutant concentration dynamics for the considered area, which is not merely related to emission sources but depends also on other factors as, for example, (micro and macro) meteorological conditions and the chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, which are all independent of the lockdown measure.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

It comprises the N-terminal regions of all six polypeptide chains of fibrin. It has been shown to contain a pair of dimeric binding sites which are complementary in binding to sites in the D domains of fibrin which are formed when fibrin polymerizes  so fragment E1 binds to fibrin dimers and polymers but not fibrin monomer or fibrinogen. Radioiodinated fragment E1 has been shown to localize in venous thrombi in a pig model. Thrombus/blood ratios of up to 100: 1 were obtained at 24 h post injection  in thrombi up to 5 days old at the time of tracer injection. In humans  deep-venous thrombi were visualized within 30 min of 123I-labelled fragment E1. Fragment E1 exhibits very rapid blood disappearance  which enhances its ability to produce high thrombus/blood ratios at early times. The thrombus uptake of labelled fragment E1 is not affected by heparin. Fragment E1 has been derivatized with metal chelating groups [diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and deferoxamine]  to facilitate labelling with 111In and 67Ga. Although these labels appeared promising in animal models  they have not yet achieved success in man.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists improve insulin sensitivity and regulate in-vitro processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Authors evaluated the effects of the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone on cognition and plasma levels of the APP derivative beta-amyloid (Abeta) in humans. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled  double-blind  parallel-group pilot study  30 subjects with mild AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment were randomized to a 6-month course of rosiglitazone (4 mg daily; N = 20) or placebo (N = 10). Primary endpoints were cognitive performance and plasma Abeta levels. RESULTS: Relative to the placebo group  subjects receiving rosiglitazone exhibited better delayed recall (at Months 4 and 6) and selective attention (Month 6). At Month 6  plasma Abeta levels were unchanged from baseline for subjects receiving rosiglitazone but declined for subjects receiving placebo  consistent with recent reports that plasma Abeta42 decreases with progression of AD. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide preliminary support that rosiglitazone may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of cognitive decline associated with AD. Future confirmation in a larger study is needed to fully demonstrate rosiglitazone's therapeutic potential.\",\n",

With most people experiencing months of lockdowns, social media may become a particularly important tool in Asian people's coping with discrimination. Grounded in the multiactivity framework of social media use, this study explored whether experience with discrimination was associated with more social media use among Asian people and how adaptive social media use was for their well-being during COVID-19. A sample of 242 Asians/Asian Americans residing in the United States (Mage=32.88, SD=11.13; 48 percent female) completed an online survey. Results showed that more experience of discrimination during COVID-19 was associated with more engagement in social media private messaging, posting/commenting, and browsing, but the activities yielded different implications for subjective well-being. Both social media private messaging and posting/commenting were associated with more perceived social support, which contributed to better subjective well-being. Social media posting/commenting was also related to better subjective well-being through lower worry about discrimination. In contrast, social media browsing was associated with poorer subjective well-being through more worry about discrimination.\",\n",

Government guidelines and restrictions implemented to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 community transmission have forced radiation therapy departments to promptly adjust to the significant impact on our ability to deliver best clinical care. The inherent nature of our tri-partied professions relies heavily on multidisciplinary teamwork and patient-clinician interactions. Teamwork and patient interaction are critical to the role of a radiation therapist. The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre's (Peter Mac) radiation therapy services during the preliminary stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in minimising risk to patients, staff and our clinical service. Four critical areas were identified in developing risk mitigation strategies across our service: (a) Workforce planning, (b) Workforce communication, (c) Patient safety and wellbeing, and (d) Staff safety and wellbeing. Each of these initiatives had a focus on continuum of clinical care, whilst minimising risk of cross infection for our radiation therapy workforce and patients alike. Initiatives included, but were not limited to, establishing COVID-Eclipse clinical protocols, remote access to local applications, implementation of Microsoft Teams, personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines and virtual 'Division of Radiation Oncology' briefing/updates. The COVID-19 pandemic has dictated change in conventional radiation therapy practice. It is hoped that by sharing our experiences, the radiation therapy profession will continue to learn, adapt and navigate this period together, to ensure optimal outcomes for ourselves and our patients.

       "  {'feature': 'Pleural ultrasound as an adjunct to physical examination in the preoperative evaluation of lung cancer patientsOBJECTIVES: Preoperative evaluation of patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer consists of clinical and radiological staging. Malignant pleural effusion is a poor prognosticator in non-small-cell lung cancer. Pleural ultrasound (PU) allows for the assessment of pleural effusion  providing real-time guidance for its aspiration and cytological analysis. Pleural Ultrasonography in Lung Cancer (PULC) as an adjunct to physical examination has the potential to improve preoperative staging of non-small-cell lung cancer during first surgical encounter by allowing the evaluation of previously unassessed pleural effusion. METHODS: This study consisted of a prospective trial of surgeon-performed PU in the preoperative evaluation of lung cancer patients. All patients evaluated in the thoracic surgery clinic with the new or presumed diagnosis of lung cancer were eligible. A portable ultrasound machine was used to evaluate pleural fluid in the bilateral costophrenic sulci with pleural fluid aspiration for cytological analysis. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were prospectively enrolled over a 3-month period. Thirteen patients had ultrasound evidence of a pleural effusion  of which 3 were significant enough for aspiration. Cytological analysis of these effusions yielded malignant cells in 1 patient. Positive PULC evaluation led to a change in clinical staging (M0 to M1a) in 10 patients and a change in pathological staging (pleural fluid cytology positive) in 1 patient. The time required for PULC examination was 15 ± 7 min. There were no complications related to the procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative pleural ultrasonography is a rapid and effective way to improve precision of staging in patients with lung cancer. More precise staging may allow for more appropriate testing  patient prognostication and operative planning. © The Author 2013.

In the present study we investigated this question in single-subject grey matter networks. This new method extracts large-scale structural graphs where nodes represent small cortical regions that are connected by edges when they show statistical similarity.

Group comparisons of standard graph properties were performed after correcting for grey matter volumetric measurements and were correlated to scores of general cognitive functioning. AD networks were characterised by a more random topology as indicated by a decreased small world coefficient (p窶=窶3.53ﾃ10(-5))  decreased normalized clustering coefficient (p窶=窶7.25ﾃ10(-6)) and decreased normalized path length (p窶=窶1.91ﾃ10(-7)).

       "  {'feature': 'Assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms in the Albanian general population during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemicBackground: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Albanian authorities declared mandatory stay-at-home measures, closing businesses, schools, and public places. This study aims to investigate the impact of these immediate changes on the mental well-being of the population. Methodology: Respondents (N = 1678) aged 18-60 years were selected through a convenient sampling method. A questionnaire was administered online for 26 days, where respondents reported the time spent daily in the COVID-19 topic and filled in their generalities, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Result(s): Findings suggest a significant negative correlation between age and anxiety scoring (r(n=1678)=-0.121, P= 0.001) and between age and depression scoring (r(n=1678)=-0.232, P= 0.001), shown also on the ANOVA test for age and anxiety (F = 6.019, P = 0.05), where younger populations had higher anxiety levels, as well as age and depression (F = 20.326, P = 0.05), where older populations had higher levels of depression. Differences on the level of education resulted in a lower score of anxiety and depression (F = 3.524, P= 0.05; F = 7.739, P= 0.05, respectively) on respondents with higher education. Those who found themselves jobless from the pandemic scored higher on anxiety and depression (F = 9.760, P= 0.05; M = 6.21, ds = 4.686 and F = 16.051, P= 0.05; M = 8.18, ds = 5.791, respectively) compared with those who are still working. Significant differences were found on the ANOVA test related to different amounts of time spent daily on the COVID-19 topic for anxiety and depression (F = 25.736, P= 0.001; F = 5.936, P= 0.003, respectively), with people who spend <1 h scoring higher on depression (M = 7.57, ds = 5.849) and those who spent >3 h scoring higher on anxiety (M = 6.76, ds = 5.60). On the t-test, people on a romantic relationship scored lower levels of depression (t =-4.053, P= 0.0001) compared to single individuals, and females scored higher levels of anxiety (t = 12.344, P= 0.001) compared to males. Conclusion(s): Younger participants score higher levels of anxiety and depression. Higher education individuals show lower levels of anxiety and depression. Having a job translates into lower levels of anxiety and depression. People who spent more time on the COVID-19 topic daily have higher levels of anxiety, whereas those who spent less time have higher levels of depression. Being in a romantic relationship relates to lower levels of depression. Females report higher levels of anxiety compared to males.

       "  {'feature': \"Endosonography-guided biliary drainage following failed ERCP: Experience from a UK tertiary referral centreIntroduction: Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is associated with significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays. [1,2] Endosonographyguided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) is an alternative to PTBD when endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) biliary decompression has failed. EUS-BD transmurally, or facilitated transpapillary drainage is possible via the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. The aims of this study were to review the technical success and adverse events with EUS-BD procedures performed at a tertiary care referral centre. Aims and Methods: Data were prospectively recorded on EUS-BD procedures performed at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust from 1st January 2016 to 26th April 2018. Procedures were performed by 2 experienced endoscopists trained in interventional EUS and ERCP. Recorded variables were technical success, adverse events, length of stay, 30-day re-admission rate and all-cause mortality. Results: 30 patients (12 male) were included. Indications for drainage were choledocholithiasis (n=8) and malignant obstruction (n=22). Reasons for failed ERCP were obscured intradiverticular ampulla (n=8), Malignant biliary obstruction prohibiting wire guided access (n=11); duodenal stenosis with inaccessible papilla (n=8; malignant, n=6; Crohn's, n=1), and failed cannulation (tumour infiltration of ampulla, n=3). The route of attempted biliary drainage was choledochoduodenostomy with lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) in 17, EUS-guided rendezvous in 9, and hepaticogastrostomy in 4. Overall technical success was achieved in 29 (97%), with 1 patient requiring PTBD. 29 cases (97%) were achieved under conscious sedation with midazolam and fentanyl. There were 2 significant bleeds; one from the sphincterotomy after a rendezvous procedure and one from a hepaticogastrostomy. Both bleeds were treated with a further endoscopic procedure. There was one instance of LAMS maldeployment, salvaged with fully covered metal stent placement over preserved wire access, and one TIA related to discontinuation of anticoagulation. 8 cases were performed as elective, out-patient procedures. Median length of stay post procedure was 6 days (range 2-80 days) for inpatient cases. There were no re-admissions within 30 days. Of the 14 patients who have died, median survival post procedure was 78 days (range 18-275 days). Conclusion: This study adds to the existing literature supporting EUS-BD as an effective and safe alternative to PTBD after failed ERCP, which can be performed under conscious sedation, often in the outpatient setting. Our technical success rate is comparable to published series. [3] Adverse event rates compared favourably with accepted rates from PTBD. [1] Experience and improved instruments should lead to further improved results. Definitive prospective, randomised studies are needed to compare outcomes for percutaneous versus EUSguided drainage.\",\n",

Immunohistochemistry using Tau-66 reveals a somatic-neuronal stain in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) that is more intense in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain than in normal brain. In hippocampus  Tau-66 yields a pattern similar to STG  except that neurofibrillary lesions are preferentially stained if present. In mild AD cases  Tau-66 stains plaques lacking obvious dystrophic neurites (termed herein 'diffuse reticulated plaques') in STG and the hippocampus. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis reveals that Tau-66 is specific for tau  as there is no cross-reactivity with MAP2  tubulin  Abeta(1-40)  or Abeta(1-42)  although Tau-66 fails to react with tau or any other polypeptide on western blots. The epitope of Tau-66  as assessed by ELISA testing of tau deletion mutants  appears discontinuous  requiring residues 155-244 and 305-314. Tau-66 reactivity exhibits buffer and temperature sensitivity in an ELISA format and is readily abolished by SDS treatment. Taken together these lines of evidence indicate that the Tau-66 epitope is conformation-dependent  perhaps involving a close interaction of the proline-rich and the third microtubule-binding regions. This is the first indication that tau can undergo this novel folding event and that this conformation of tau is involved in AD pathology.\",\n",

In this study, the relationship between BCG vaccination status and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and the factors affecting disease severity were investigated. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between March-June 2020 in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction positivity in a nasopharyngeal sample and pulmonary infiltrates in computed chest tomography, in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Sociodemographic features, body mass index, smoking status, concomitant diseases, income rates, and BCG vaccination status of subjects were analyzed. RESULTS: Study population consisted of 123 adults with COVID-19 pneumonia (mean age, 49.7 years [standard deviation, 13.3 years]; 82 (66.7%) male). While the rate of cases vaccinated with BCG is lower (68.5% vs 88.2%; p=.026), the mean age (54.0 +/- 11.5 years vs 38.3 +/-10.7 years; p <.001), diabetes (32.6% vs 5.9%; p=.002) and low income (84.3% vs 52.9% p<.001) are higher in patients with severe disease compared to those with mild disease. According to multivariate analysis increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.119; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.062 - 1.178; p<.001) and low income (OR, 3.209; 95% CI, 1.008 - 10.222; p =.049) are associated with severe disease in COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that BCG vaccination is not associated with disease severity in COVID-19 pneumonia. Age and low income are the main determinants of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

The present study aimed to assess the gender-dependent hand hygiene and personal protective behaviors in a national sample of Polish adolescents. The Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study was conducted in a group of 2323 secondary school students (814 males, 1509 females). Schools were chosen based on the random quota sampling procedure. The participants were surveyed to assess their knowledge and beliefs associated with hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as their actual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of respondents gave proper answers when asked about their knowledge. However, females displayed a higher level of knowledge (p < 0.05). Most of the respondents declared not leaving home, handwashing, using alcohol-based hand rub, avoiding contact with those who may be sick, and avoiding public places as their personal protective behaviors. They declared using face masks and gloves after the legal regulation requiring people to cover their nose and mouth in public places was enacted in Poland. Regarding the use of face masks and not touching the face, no gender-dependent differences were observed, while for all the other behaviors, females declared more adherence than males (p < 0.05). Females also declared a higher daily frequency of handwashing (p < 0.0001) and washing their hands always when necessary more often than males (68.2% vs. 54.1%; p < 0.0001). Males more often indicated various reasons for not handwashing, including that there is no need to do it, they do not feel like doing it, they have no time to do it, or they forget about it (p < 0.0001), while females pointed out side effects (e.g., skin problems) as the reason (p = 0.0278). Females more often declared handwashing in circumstances associated with socializing, being exposed to contact with other people and health (p < 0.05), and declared always including the recommended steps in their handwashing procedure (p < 0.05). The results showed that female secondary school students exhibited a higher level of knowledge on hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as better behaviors, compared to males. However, irrespective of gender, some false beliefs and improper behaviors were observed, which suggests that education is necessary, especially in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': \"Prevention of postsurgical recurrence in Crohn's disease: Is it possible?Crohn's disease (CD) is diagnosed in about 20 % of patients before the age of 18 years. Its phenotype is more complicated than in adult-onset CD and requires more aggressive therapy, including surgery. Surgery rates in pediatric CD range between 10 and 72 %. Indications for surgery include medically refractory disease (especially with growth failure) and complicated behaviour. Surgery is crucial, allowing children to catch up in growth and height before late puberty. However, surgery is not curative and post-operative recurrence (POR) is almost inevitable. Even if pediatric data are scarce, clinical recurrence has been reported in 50-94 % and re-operation in 18-54 % of cases, depending on the follow-up time. Thus, prevention of POR has a decisive role in managing CD. Several strategies have been used to decrease POR, with only some being efficacious and not in all cases. Therefore, currently, no standard of care for the management of postoperative CD does exist. The published studies in adults, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown efficacy for thiopurines, nitroimidazole antibiotics and anti-TNFﾎｱ agents, while budesonide, probiotics and interleukin-10 were not effective. Although safe, mesalazine is of little benefit and not recommended, except in few selected patients. Since no randomized-controlled trial has been performed in children, data have to be extrapolated from adults and enteral nutrition may play an important role. In the prevention of recurrence, it is imperative to consider its risk factors, how it should be assessed, and what medication to use in relation to risk factors and cost-efficacy, based on actual evidence.\",\n",

Mean number of antiarrhythmic drugs per patient was 3 (from 1 to 8). Examination included Holter ECG monitoring  echocardiography  determination of anticardiac antibodies (97.4%) and markers of cardiotropic viruses (87.4%)  treadmill test (26.3%)  transesophageal cardiac pacing (12.1%)  electrophysiological investigation (10%)  multispiral computed tomography (22.1%)  magnetic resonance tomography (21.6%)  scintigraphy (27.4%)  coronary angiography (10.0%)  endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) (10.0%)  DNA diagnostics (8.9%). RESULTS: EMB revealed immune-inflammatory (myo/endocarditis  systemic/myocardial vasculitis) or genetic pathology in 78.9 and 21.1% of cases  respectively. Level of anticardiac antibodies (including specific antinuclear factor) most closely correlated with EMB findings. On the basis of comparison of EMB data with data of complex examination we created algorithm of nosological diagnostics in \"idiopathic\" arrhythmias. According to nosology all patients were distributed in the following way: 1) chronic infectious-immune myocarditis (n=144  75.7%)  morphologically verified in 14  viral in 27 patients; 2) genetic cardiomyopathy (n=15  7.9%)  morphologically verified in 4  virus positive in 1 (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia  non-compaction myocardium  Fabri disease  Brugada syndrome  undetermined); in 4 patients mutations in plakophilin 2  desmoglein  desmin  -galactosidase A genes were found; 3) combination of genetic diseases with myocarditis (n=18; 9.5%) including viral (n=3); 4) isolated myocardiodystrophy (tonsillogenic< dyshormonal  n=3  1.6%); 5) proper idiopathic arrhythmias (n=10  5.3%). Therapy of myocarditis included antiviral (43.2%) and immunosuppressive (76.3%) drugs. Cardiotropic and antiarrhythmic therapy was also administered. Only in patients with myocarditis it was possible to withdraw effective antiarrhythmic (16.7%) and to improve effect of previously ineffective drugs. Surgical treatment (implantation of pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator  radiofrequency ablation) was more frequently used in patients with genetic (39.4%) and idiopathic arrhythmias (53.8%) than in patients with myocarditis (16.0%). CONCLUSION: Etiology of idiopathic arrhythmias can be established in most cases. Their main causes are immune-inflammatory diseases  genetic cardiomyopathies and their combination. Therapy of myocarditis improves antiarrhythmic activity of treatment  in some patients allows to withdraw antiarrhythmic drugs  decrease requirements in surgical treatment and to optimally prepare patients to radiofrequency ablation.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Early Experience with Arterial Thromboembolic Complications in Patents with COVID-19INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the arterial complications and hypercoagulability associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We sought to characterize our experience with arterial thromboembolic complications in patients with hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: All patients admitted from March 1 to April 20, 2020 and who underwent carotid, upper, lower and aortoiliac arterial duplex, CT angiogram or MRA for suspected arterial thrombosis were included. A retrospective case-control study design was used to identify, characterize and evaluate potential risk factors for arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Demographics, characteristics and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 424 patients underwent 499 arterial duplex, CT angiogram or MRA imaging studies with overall 9.4% positive for arterial thromboembolism. Of the 40 patients with arterial thromboembolism, 25 (62.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons and 15 (37.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The odds ratio for arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 was 3.37 (95% CI 1.68 - 6.78, p=0.001). Although not statistically significant, in patients with arterial thromboembolism, patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive compared to those testing negative or not tested tended to be male (66.7 % v. 40.0%, p=0.191), have a less frequent history of former or active smoking (42.9% vs 68.0%, p=0.233) and have a higher white blood cell count (WBC 14.5 vs. 9.9, p=0.208). While the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients trended toward a higher the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (8.9 vs. 4.1, p=0.134), CPK level (359.0 vs. 144.5, p=0.667), CRP level (24.2 vs. 13.8, p=0.627), LDH level (576.5 vs. 338.0, p=0.313) and ferritin level (974.0 vs. 412.0, p=0.47), these did not reach statistical significance. Patients with arterial thromboembolic complications and SARS-CoV-2 positive when compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons were younger (64 vs. 70 years, p=0.027), had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (32.6 vs. 25.5, p=0.012), a higher D-dimer at the time of imaging (17.3 vs. 1.8, p=0.038), a higher average in hospital D-dimer (8.5 vs. 2.0, p=0.038), a greater distribution of patients with clot in the aortoiliac location (5 vs. 1, p=0.040), less prior use of any antiplatelet medication (21.4% vs. 62.5%, p=0.035) and a higher mortality rate (40.0 % vs. 8.0%, p=0.041). Treatment of arterial thromboembolic disease in the COVID-19 positive patients included open thromboembolectomy in 6 patients (40%), anticoagulation alone in 4 (26.7%) and 5 (33.3%) did not require or their overall illness severity precluded additional treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SAR-CoV-2 are at risk for acute arterial thromboembolic complications despite a lack of conventional risk factors. A hyperinflammatory state may be responsible for this phenomenon with a preponderance for aortoiliac involvement. These findings provide an early characterization of arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Copyright Â© 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.',\n",

COVID-19-related closed- and open-ended questions were included. A mixed-methods approach assessed COVID-19-related changes in well-being and sexual health by outness with an accepting guardian. RESULTS: The majority (57%) of participants reported being worried about COVID-19. Almost all (91%) were physically distancing. Participants noted that COVID-19 changed school, home, work, and family life. Participants highlighted that COVID-19 reduced their ability to socialize and had a deleterious effect on their mental health. In the past 3 months, participants reported seeing sexual partners in person less often, masturbating and viewing pornography more often, and sexting and messaging on men-seeking-men websites/phone applications about the same amount. Many described being physically distanced from sexual partners, and some noted an increase in their use of virtual ways to connect with partners (e.g., video chatting). There were no differences by outness with an accepting guardian in quantitative or qualitative responses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a snapshot of the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among a convenience sample of U.S. ASMM and underscore the need to provide access to resources sensitive to their social, developmental, and sexual health needs during this crisis.

Despite of recent advances in imaging tools such as computed tomography (CT) scan  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasongraphy  hysterosalpingography has been considered as the standard screening test for evaluation of tubal infertility and as a valuable tool for diagnosis of female genital tuberculosis. Tuberculosis gives rise to various appearances on hysterosalpingography (HSG) from non-specific changes to specific findings. The present pictorial review illustrates and describes specific and non-specific radiographic features of female genital tuberculosis in two parts. Part I presents specific findings of tuberculosis related to tubes such as \"beaded tube\"  \"golf club tube\"  \"pipestem tube\"  \"cobble stone tube\" and the \"leopard skin tube\". Part II will describe adverse effects of tuberculosis on structure of endometrium and radiological specific findings  such as \"T-shaped\" tuberculosis uterus  \"pseudo-unicornuate \"uterus  \"collar-stud abscess\" and \"dwarfed\" uterus with lymphatic intravasation and occluded tubes which have not been encountered in the majority of non-tuberculosis cases.',\n",

The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has had implications in the central nervous system. COVID-19 is known to be characterized by coagulation activation and endothelial dysfunction, causing ischemic and hemorrhagic vascular syndromes. Case Description: A 27-year-old male patient case with progressive decrease in visual acuity, associated with respiratory symptoms and intense headache. Multilobar infiltrate with a reticulonodular pattern is evident on chest CT scan. Brain CT scan with pituitary macroadenoma apoplexy was shown. SARS-Cov2 was confirmed, and respiratory support initiated. However, the patient died shortly afterward, secondary to pulmonary complications. Conclusion(s): The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II receptor is expressed in circumventricular organs and in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, which play a role in vascular autoregulation and cerebral blood flow. For this reason, is rational the hypothesize that brain ACE II could be involved in COVID-19 infection. Underlying mechanisms require further elucidation in the future.

We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Result(s): COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitation(s): Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Conclusion(s): Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

It is inexpensive, free of ionising-radiation and well tolerated. We looked at outcomes in SB US in our CD population. Methods Retrospective analysis of SB US for patients with known or suspected CD between June 2016 to February 2017 in Frimley Park Hospital. Data was collected from PACS, clinic letters and endoscopy reports. Result 91 US scans in a total of 83 patients were performed by a single, dedicated GI radiologist (6 patients had more than one US). Patient age range 7-80 years (median 29 years); 53 female (64%), 30 male (36%). 21/91 (23%) US were performed for assessment of symptomatic flare in those with established CD. 16/21 (76%) had active disease on US (81% terminal ileitis; 6.3% stricture, 6.3% fistula, 6.3% abscess). Of these, 4 had MRE and 2 had colonoscopy which correlated with US findings. 11/16 (69%) had treatment escalation following US (55% started anti-TNF, 18% steroids, 9% Vedolizumab, 9% enteral, 9% surgery).

PURPOSE: To examine the effectiveness of N95, surgical, and cloth masks in community and health care settings for preventing respiratory virus infections, and effects of reuse or extended use of N95 masks. DATA SOURCES: Multiple electronic databases, including the World Health Organization COVID-19 database and medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 14 April 2020; surveillance through 2 June 2020), and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of masks and risk for respiratory virus infection, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and observational studies of mask use and coronavirus infection risk were included. New evidence will be incorporated by using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; a second reviewer provided verification. DATA SYNTHESIS: 39 studies (18 randomized controlled trials and 21 observational studies; 33 867 participants) were included. No study evaluated reuse or extended use of N95 masks. Evidence on SARS-CoV-2 was limited to 2 observational studies with serious limitations. Community mask use was possibly associated with decreased risk for SARS-CoV-1 infection in observational studies. In high- or moderate-risk health care settings, observational studies found that risk for infection with SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus probably decreased with mask use versus nonuse and possibly decreased with N95 versus surgical mask use. Randomized trials in community settings found possibly no difference between N95 versus surgical masks and probably no difference between surgical versus no mask in risk for influenza or influenza-like illness, but compliance was low. In health care settings, N95 and surgical masks were probably associated with similar risks for influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed viral infection; clinical respiratory illness had inconsistency. Bothersome symptoms were common. LIMITATIONS: There were few SARS-CoV-2 studies, observational studies have methodological limitations, and the review was done by using streamlined methods. CONCLUSION: Evidence on mask effectiveness for respiratory infection prevention is stronger in health care than community settings. N95 respirators might reduce SARS-CoV-1 risk versus surgical masks in health care settings, but applicability to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain.

       "  {'feature': 'Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During The Covid-19 Pandemic In The Indian SubcontinentBACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to it. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, when compared to the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable rise in covid infections with its gradual relaxation continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on the same especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operation theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice all over the country. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. RESULTS: A total of 176 responses were received from all over the Indian Sub-Continent. The median age of respondents was 39years (range 32-70 yrs) and the post-residency experience was 7years (range 0-34 yrs). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. 46% of the respondents were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (p=0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services(26% vs 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N-95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practised precautionary measures in outpatient services(>60%). While private practitioners were continuing elective cases(40%), public institutes were more cautious with only emergencies being operated(29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to the family (75%). Social media was helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats upon social media platforms(37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. CONCLUSION: The survey highlights the perception of the neurosurgeons towards the pandemic and the difference in public-private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of the regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal OPD/OR practices and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by PPE usage and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Though telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, yet online education has been favourably received. Copyright Â© 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.',\n",

We have previously published clinical studies where the effect of statin treatment on Abeta production has been investigated. No effect on Abeta was found  which is in disagreement with cell and animal studies. In the present study we investigated the effect of statin treatment on a disease-specific pattern consisting of a C-terminally-truncated quintet of Abeta peptides. Nineteen patients with AD were treated with simvastatin for 12 months and the quintet of Abeta peptides were analysed in cerebrospinal fluid before and after treatment. Also included was a group of 15 untreated patients with AD. We found that the Abeta peptide pattern at baseline was in agreement with earlier findings; however  we did not find any change in the Abeta peptide pattern after statin treatment. We suggest that clinical studies with extended treatment periods are performed where higher dosages of statins are used.

Although there is increasing evidence for the involvement of retinoids in Alzheimer's disease  their significance in the regulation of Alphabeta-peptide production remains unresolved. Our work concentrated on the regulation of all secretases mediated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)  and supports the hypothesis that ATRA is capable of regulating them in an antiamyloidogenic sense at the levels of transcription  translation  and activation. Apart from increased alpha-secretase activity  we show a complex chain of regulatory events  resulting in impaired beta-secretase trafficking and membrane localization upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation by ATRA. Furthermore  ATRA demonstrates substrate specificity for beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) 1 over nonamyloidogenic BACE2 in beta-secretase regulation  which probably promotes competition for amyloid precursor protein between ADAM17 and BACE1. Additionally  we report enhanced secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha after ATRA exposure  possibly due to PKC activation  as pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor Gﾃｶ6976 abolished all these events.\",\n",

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Identify classic imaging characteristics of tuberculous lymphadenitis. CASE: A 45-year-old Peruvian male prisoner with human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(HIV/AIDS) presented with right flank pain  intermittent fevers  chills  and night sweats for 3 weeks. Prior to 7 months of incarceration  he traveled internationally throughout Central and South America and eastern Asia. He denied weight loss  abdominal pain  dysuria  or hematuria. He was never treated for his HIV. As a child  he received the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination  but had no known exposure to tuberculosis. Sputum cultures and Quantiferon Gold were negative 3 weeks prior to presentation. On initial examthe patient was febrile to 101.3 degreeF with tachycardia to 112  with otherwise normal vital signs. The patient complained of R flank pain  however his abdomen and back were non-tender to palpation and there were no palpable lymph nodes on exam. Laboratory testing revealed a CD4 count of 24/muL  white blood cell count of 4100/mm<sup>3</sup>  hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL  and hematocrit of 36.3 %. Other labs tests were within normal limits. Blood cultures showed no growth. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli was negative on three occasions but Quantiferon Gold assay was positive. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was negative for pathology. CT of his abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a solitary enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node located posterior to the transverse duodenum (1.8x2.1x3.9 cm) with a central area of low attenuation. Endoscopic ultrasound was used to assist with biopsy the lesion given its precarious location. Ziehl-Neelsen stain of the specimen demonstrated numerous acid fast bacilli. Polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was started on on rifampin  isoniazid  pyrazinamide  and ethambutol for treatment of tuberulosis and antiretrovirals for treatment of his HIV. He expereienced resolution of symptoms within 1.5 weeks and was discharged without complications. DISCUSSION: The differential diagnosis for an HIV patient with an isolated enlarged lymph node includes malignancy  infection  and inflammatory conditions. However  in patients with several known risk factors (incarceration  immunodeficiency and recent travel to endemic areas)  tuberculosis should be strongly considered even in cases of atypical presentation. Isolated extra-pulmonary tuberculosis accounts for 21 % of tuberculosis in the United States  usually presenting as tuberculous lymphadenitis. Most (60%) tuberculous lymphadenitis is localized to the cervical lymphatic region. Abdominal tuberculosis comprises only 12 % of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis although the rate is increased in patients with immunodeficiency. Within the abdomen  gastrointestinal and genitourinary tuberculosis are the most common  followed by tuberculous lymphadenitis. Isolated retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement in tuberculosis remains more rare  as most cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis present as several matted lymph nodes  often palpable on exam. CT imaging usually reveals low attenuating central necrosis with a hyper-attenuating area of rim enhancement  consistent with an inflammatory response. In our patient  CT revealed a central area of caseation without rim enhancement. Biopsy by EUS provided a minimally invasive method to help identify active tuberculosis in a solitary nodule at an atypical location with localized symptoms of flank pain. Therefore  in patients at risk for tuberculosis  biopsy of even a single lymph node must be pursued vigorously in order to establish a diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment for the patient.',\n",

Over a million cases have been confirmed in the United States. As of May 5, 2020, New York State has had over 300,000 cases and 24,000 deaths with more than half of the cases and deaths occurring in New York City (NYC). Little is known, however, of how this virus impacts pregnancy. Given this lack of data and the risk for severe disease in this relatively immunocompromised population, further understanding of the obstetrical management of COVID-19, as well as hospital level preparation for its control, is crucial. Guidance has come from expert opinion, professional societies and public health agencies, but to date, there is no report on how obstetrical practices have adapted these recommendations to their local situations. We therefore developed an internet-based survey to elucidate the practices put into place to guide the care of obstetrical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed obstetrical leaders in four academic medical centers in NYC who were implementing and testing protocols at the height of the pandemic. We found that all sites made changes to their practices, and that there appeared to be agreement with screening and testing for COVID-19, as well as labor and delivery protocols, for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. We found less consensus with respect to inpatient antepartum fetal surveillance. We hope that this experience is useful to other centers as they formulate their plans to face this pandemic.

To facilitate an unbiased search for the sequence determinants of Abeta aggregation  we developed a genetic screen that couples a readily observable phenotype in E. coli to the ability of a mutation in Abeta42 to reduce aggregation. The screen is based on our finding that fusions of the wild-type Abeta42 sequence to green fluorescent protein (GFP) form insoluble aggregates in which GFP is inactive. Cells expressing such fusions do not fluoresce. To isolate variants of Abeta42 with reduced tendencies to aggregate  we constructed and screened libraries of Abeta42-GFP fusions in which the sequence of Abeta42 was mutated randomly. Cells expressing GFP fusions to soluble (non-aggregating) variants of Abeta42 exhibit green fluorescence. Implementation of this screen enabled the isolation of 36 variants of Abeta42 with reduced tendencies to aggregate. The sequences of most of these variants are consistent with previous models implicating hydrophobic regions as determinants of Abeta42 aggregation. Some of the variants  however  contain amino acid substitutions not implicated in pre-existing models of Abeta amyloidogenesis.\",\n",

However, no specific data are currently available for these patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 401 patients with ILD and determined the proportion of patients hospitalized for proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and specific symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that 1% of patients (n = 4) were hospitalized (1 in ICU) for COVID-19. In total, 310 of the 401 patients answered the phone call. Only 33 patients (0.08%) experienced specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Our study did not demonstrate any increased occurrence of severe COVID-19 in ILD patients compared to the global population. Based on our findings, we could not make any conclusion on the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with ILDs, or on the overall outcome of immunocompromised patients affected by COVID-19.

Case report: A healthy 73-years old woman admitted to the ED for dyspnea, fever and thoracic pain. Cardiac ultrasound, electrocardiogram and clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of cardiogenic obstructive shock due to acute pulmonary embolism, successfully treated with thrombolysis. A CT angiography confirmed the pulmonary embolism (EP) diagnosis and showed bilateral pneumonia, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: Considering the high prevalence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients it is mandatory for the emergency physician to systematically evaluate signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, in order to perform the most patient-tailored therapy as soon as possible.

Despite typical manifestations of illness are dominated by respiratory symptom, some patients have concurrent gastrointestinal manifestations, including nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Massive gastrointestinal bleeding, however, has rarely been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein described a case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infected patient with several risk factors for poor prognosis, including male, hypertension, old age, mixed bacterial infection and multilobular infiltration on radiological imaging. After improvement of respiratory status, the onset of gastrointestinal bleeding occurred, probably resulting from direct viral invasion as evidenced by the positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in the repeat stool specimens. Although aggressive resuscitation was administered, hematochezia was uncontrolled. The patient rapidly deteriorated, suffered from cardiac arrest, and expired. CONCLUSIONS: Digestive symptoms could be severe in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, especially for the high-risk individuals with predisposing conditions.

In the early days of a pandemic, the adherence to regulations is crucial to be able to block its spread. This research aims to analyse the relationship between motivational variables associated with physical distancing and self-interested consumption behaviours in the first 10 days of confinement in Spain. A total of 1,324 people participated throughout the country (mean age 28.92 years). Participants answered an online survey about socio-demographic, motivational variables, which included a) risk information seeking, b) confidence in self- and collective efficacy in coping with the pandemic, and c) the four higher-order personal values -conservation (security, conformity, and tradition), self-transcendence (universalism and benevolence), openness (self-direction actions and stimulation), and self-improvement (hedonism and power) - and the aforementioned behaviours in coping with Covid-19. Results showed a positive association between self- and collective efficacy and both coping behaviours analysed: a protective role of conservation values on normative behaviours; and a negative relationship between self-transcendence values and self-interested consumption. Additionally, risk information seeking was positively associated with the development of physical distancing behaviour.Copyright: Â© 2020 Tabernero et al.

Further  we investigate associations between TDP-43 inclusions and other key dementia-related neuropathologies (plaques  tangles  and neuronal loss) within the hippocampus and entorhinal and temporal cortices. METHODS: All brain donors within the Cambridge City over-75 s Cohort (CC75C)  which is population-based and longitudinally tracked (n = 228)  were included. Age at death ranged from 78 to 106 years. TDP-43 neuronal inclusions were assessed in the hippocampus  entorhinal cortex  and temporal cortex. These data were combined with existing clinical and neuropathological data. RESULTS: TDP-43 neuronal inclusions were present in 27% of the sample  36% of those with clinical dementia and 18% without dementia. Individuals who died later (>90 years) or with clinical dementia were more likely to show TDP-43 inclusions. Hippocampal and entorhinal TDP-43 inclusions were significantly associated with dementia severity and increasing age  taking into account other neuropathologies. TDP-43 neuronal inclusions appeared to be co-localize with severe neuronal loss. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that hippocampal and entorhinal TDP-43 inclusions are important substrates of late onset dementia which appear to co-localize with severe neuronal loss  but not with Alzheimer's disease markers of amyloid and tau.

We demonstrated a utility of using traditional contact tracing measures supplemented with symptom tracking and contact management system to assist public health workers with high efficiency. METHODS: A centralized contact tracing system was developed to support data linkage, cross-jurisdictional coordination, and follow-up of contacts' health status. We illustrated the process of how digital tools support contact tracing and management of COVID-19 cases and measured the timeliness from case detection to contact monitoring to evaluate system performance. RESULTS: Among the 8,051 close contacts of the 487 confirmed cases (16.5 close contacts/case, 95% CI [13.9-19.1]), the median elapsed time from last exposure to quarantine was three days (IQR 1-5). By implementing the approach of self-reporting using automatic text-messages and web-app, the percentage of health status updates from self-reporting increased from 22.5% to 61.5%. The high proportion of secondary cases detected via contact tracing (88%) might reduce the R0 to under one and minimize the impact of local transmission in the community.

The use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy.Tau is hyperphosphorylated and undergoes proteolysis in Alzheimer disease brain. Caspase-cleaved tau efficiently forms fibrillary structures in vitro and in situ. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylates tau and induces the aggregation of caspase-cleaved tau in situ. Given the hypothesis that increased association of tau precedes the formation of fibrillar structures  we generated a cell model to quantitate the extent of tau association in situ using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. The cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins were attached to full-length (T4) and caspase-cleaved (T4C3) tau at either the N or C termini  and a pair of cyan and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged tau were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney cells. The FRET efficiency was examined in the presence of a constitutively active or a kinase-dead GSK3beta. Active GSK3beta significantly increased FRET efficiency with both T4 and T4C3  indicating that GSK3beta activation resulted in an increase in the self-association of both T4 and T4C3  but interestingly only T4 is efficiently phosphorylated by GSK3beta. There was no significant difference in FRET efficiency between T4 and T4C3  although only T4C3 in the presence of active GSK3beta leads to the formation of Sarkosyl-insoluble inclusions. These FRET studies demonstrate that GSK3beta facilitates the association of T4 and T4C3  and the presence of caspase-cleaved tau is necessary for the evolution of tau oligomers into Sarkosyl-insoluble inclusions even though it is not extensively phosphorylated. These data imply that increased association of tau should not be regarded as a direct indicator of the formation of insoluble tau aggregates.',\n",

This feature is important due to the potential transmissibility of COVID-19 through these cases. There is a variety of atypical clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations among children infected with COVID-19. Case presentation: We report two sisters with COVID-19 pneumonia who had close contact with their 77-year-old grandmother. Their grandmother expired with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The older sister (15 years old) firstly presented with severe cough, fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, and lymphopenia. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed atypical lobar pneumonic infiltration only in the left lower lobe. The younger sister (6 years old) was affected the following day with milder symptoms (i.e., fever and cough). Her chest CT scan demonstrated typical mild generalized patchy ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening scattered in both lungs. The CT presentation of their grandmother showed typical bilateral white lungs with crazy paving appearance. The standard regimen for both sisters was administrated, and the patients' respiratory conditions improved after 5 days of treatment. Both cases were discharged with good general conditions.

The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200-5000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 x 103 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, with sequence confirmation of the qPCR product, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 x 103-8.2 x 104 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 x 102-2.5 x 103 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5000 mL.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in 30-45 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic sequence. RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from actual COVID-19 patients was also tested. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 in both simulated patient samples and clinical specimens. This test was performed in 30-45 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.',\n",

High-resolution images at 4T depict details of the internal structure of the hippocampus allowing for in vivo volumetry of hippocampal subfields. The aims of this study were (1) to determine patterns of hippocampal subfield volume loss due to normal aging and Apo e4 carrier state  (2) to determine subfield specific volume losses due to preclinical (MCI) and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their modification due to age and Apo e4 carrier state. One hundred fifty seven subjects (119 cognitively healthy elderly controls  20 MCI and 18 AD) were studied with a high resolution T2 weighted imaging sequence obtained at 4T aimed at the hippocampus. Apo e4 carrier state was known in 95 subjects (66 controls  14 MCI  15 AD). Subiculum (SUB)  CA1  CA1-CA2 transition zone (CA1-2 transition)  CA3- dentate gyrus (CA3&DG) were manually marked. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test for effects of age  Apo e4 carrier state and effects of MCI and AD on different hippocampal subfields. Age had a significant negative effect on CA1 and CA3&DG volumes in controls (P < 0.05). AD had significantly smaller volumes of SUB  CA1  CA1-2 transition  and MCI had smaller CA1-2 transition volumes than controls (P < 0.05). Apo e4 carrier state was associated with volume loss in CA3&DG compared to non-Apo e4 carriers in healthy controls and AD. Based on these findings  we conclude that subfield volumetry provides regional selective information that allows to distinguish between different normal and pathological processes affecting the hippocampus and thus for an improved differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases affecting the hippocampus.\",\n",

With no effective treatment or vaccine, prolonged mechanical ventilation is common in survivors. Timing and performance of tracheostomy, for both patient and surgical team safety, remains a question. Here within, we report our experience with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy with modification to minimize aerosolization. METHODS: A modified percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy technique is described. The technique was performed on 10 patients in the surgical intensive care unit. RESULTS: Ten patients underwent percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. There were 7 males, and the average age for the group was 60.8 years. The average number of ventilator days before the operation was 26.3. All procedures were successful, and no patient had any procedure-related complications.

While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Objective: To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results: Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years. Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%). Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients). At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults. Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children. These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.',\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance (MR) images of human cadaver brain hemispheres were collected using a gradient echo based SWI sequence at 1.5T. For X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping  each brain was cut to obtain slices that reasonably matched the MR images and iron was mapped at the iron K-edge at 50 or 100 microm resolution. Iron was quantified using XRF calibration foils. Phase and iron XRF were averaged within anatomic regions of one slice  chosen for its range of iron concentrations and nearly perfect anatomic correspondence. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to determine if the chemical form of iron was different in regions with poorer correspondence between iron and phase. RESULTS: Iron XRF maps  SWI  and high pass filtered phase data in nine brain slices from five subjects were visually very similar  particularly in high iron regions. The chemical form of iron could not explain poor matches. The correlation between the concentration of iron and phase in the cadaver brain was estimated as c(Fe) [microg/g tissue] = 850Deltavarpi + 110. CONCLUSION: The phase shift Deltavarpi was found to vary linearly with iron concentration with the best correspondence found in regions with high iron content.',\n",

We found a decrease in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity associated with an increase in inhibitory phosphorylation of its catalytic subunit PP2Ac at Tyr(307) and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in brains of patients who had Guam PD. To test the possible involvement of BMAA in the etiopathogenesis of PD  we studied the effect of this environmental neurotoxin on PP2A activity and tau hyperphosphorylation in mouse primary neuronal cultures and metabolically active rat brain slices. BMAA treatment significantly decreased PP2A activity  with a concomitant increase in tau kinase activity resulting in elevated tau hyperphosphorylation at PP2A favorable sites. Moreover  we found an increase in the phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Tyr(307) in BMAA-treated rat brains. Pretreatment with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and Src antagonists blocked the BMAA-induced inhibition of PP2A and the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau  indicating the involvement of an Src-dependent PP2A pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that BMAA treatment dissociated PP2Ac from mGluR5  making it available for phosphorylation at Tyr(307). These findings suggest a scenario in which BMAA can lead to tau pathology by inhibiting PP2A through the activation of mGluR5  the consequent release of PP2Ac from the mGluR5-PP2A complex  and its phosphorylation at Tyr(307) by Src.',\n",

However  the causal link between Abeta and neuron death in vivo remains unclear since most animal models fail to recapitulate the dramatic cell loss observed in AD. We have recently developed transgenic mice that overexpress human APP and PS1 with five familial AD mutations (5XFAD mice) and exhibit robust neuron death. Here  we demonstrate that genetic deletion of the beta-secretase (BACE1) not only abrogates Abeta generation and blocks amyloid deposition but also prevents neuron loss found in the cerebral cortex and subiculum  brain regions manifesting the most severe amyloidosis in 5XFAD mice. Importantly  BACE1 gene deletion also rescues memory deficits in 5XFAD mice.

Abeta exists in soluble monomeric and oligomeric forms and in an insoluble polymerised fibrillar form  but it is not clear which of these plays the most important role in the etiology of AD. In vitro  Abeta(1-42) interacts with ACT  and as a result of this  ACT loses its proteinase inhibitor activity and polymerisation of Abeta(1-42) is promoted. Here we provide evidence that new molecular forms resulting from incubation of ACT with Abeta(1-42) have multiple cellular level effects on neuronal cells. The mixture of soluble Abeta and an ACT/Abeta complex formed by 2 hr incubation at a 10:1 molar ratio of Abeta:ACT strongly induce cellular proliferation and expression of transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and NFkappaB  and also increase uptake and depress degradation of native and oxidised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by cells. Similar but less pronounced effects are seen when cells are exposed to the Abeta peptide alone preincubated for 2 hr. Abeta(1-42) and to a lesser extent ACT/Abeta(1-42) complex mixture prepared by 2 hr incubation both inhibit association of native LDL with cells. Neither ACT alone nor the Abeta(1-42) and ACT/Abeta(1-42) forms prepared by 24-hr incubation show any significant effects in these assays. We propose that specific molecular forms of Abeta(1-42) and ACT/Abeta(1-42) complex mixture  both dependent on the abundances of Abeta(1-42) and ACT/Abeta(1-42) in vivo and on their time of exposure to each other  have cellular effects which are important for the initiation and progression of the pathologies associated with AD.\",\n",

The differential diagnosis for her symptoms included Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, appendicitis, intussusception, cholecystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, peptic ulcer and colchicinerefractory FMF flare. Physical exam was unremarkable, except for abdominal tenderness predominantly in the RLQ with modest guarding. Laboratory evaluation showed normal electrolytes, CBC, amylase/ lipase, TFTs, PTH and vitamin levels. Stool and urine cultures were negative. Gynecologic evaluation, including transvaginal ultrasound, was normal. MRE showed no evidence of bowel wall inflammation or obstruction. Upper endoscopy biopsies showed a chronic chemical gastropathy with no Barrett's, no H. pylori, and normal jejunal villous architecture. Colonoscopy was normal, with normal terminal ileum and colonic mucosal biopsies. Given the recurrence of symptoms and greater than one febrile attack per month, the patient was deemed to have colchicine-resistant FMF and was referred to rheumatology for initiation of anti-IL1ﾎｲ biologic therapy. Discussion: FMF is a hereditary auto-inflammatory disease characterized by periodic fevers and serositis triggered by deregulated inflammasome production of IL-1ﾎｲ. With peritonitis, abdominal pain and fever being the most common manifestations, gastroenterologists need to consider FMF in the DDX of IBDassociated inflammatory symptoms. FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene encoding pyrin. Mutant pyrin fails to regulate caspase-1 activity and additionally activates NFﾎｺB. Careful follow-up of FMF patients is critical as they are at increased risk of developing late-onset IBD. This increased risk for IBD may be related to the close association of the CD-susceptibility gene NOD2 with the MEFV gene on chromosome 16. Pyrin also interacts with the innate immune intracellular NOD-like receptor Nlrp3, which has been shown to contribute to Crohn's susceptibility. Nlrp3 is a crucial regulator of intestinal homeostasis, mediating assembly of the inflammasome complex in the presence of microbial ligands, triggering caspase-1 activation and secretion of IL-1ﾎｲ and IL-18. Although colchicine is the first line of treatment for FMF, case reports have shown some efficacy with anti-TNF biologics. However, IL-1ﾎｲ biologics are emerging as the best second-line therapy for colchicine-resistant FMF patients. Despite the FMF and IBD overlap in inflammasome deregulation of the IL-1ﾎｲ pathway, studies are lacking on the effectiveness of colchicine or anti-IL-1ﾎｲ therapy for IBD.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Morphologically distinct types of amyloid plaques point the way to a better understanding of Alzheimer\\'s disease pathogenesis.The details of the sequence of pathological events leading to neuron death in Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) are not known. Even the formation of amyloid plaques  one of the major histopathological hallmarks of AD  is not clearly understood; both the origin of the amyloid and the means of its deposition remain unclear. It is still widely considered  however  that amyloid plaques undergo gradual growth in the interstitial space of the brain via continual extracellular deposition of amyloid beta peptides at \"seeding sites \" and that these growing plaques encroach progressively on neurons and their axons and dendritic processes  eventually leading to neuronal death. Actually  histopathological evidence to support this mechanism is sparse and of uncertain validity. The fact that the amyloid deposits in AD brains that are collectively referred to as plaques are of multiple types and that each seems to have a different origin often is overlooked. We have shown experimentally that many of the so-called \"diffuse amyloid plaques \" which lack associated inflammatory cells  are either the result of leaks of amyloid from blood vessels at focal sites of blood-brain barrier breaches or are artifacts resulting from grazing sections through the margins of dense core plaques. In addition  we have provided experimental evidence that neuronal death via necrosis leaves a residue that takes the form of a spheroid \"cloud\" of amyloid  released by cell lysis  surrounding a dense core that often contains neuronal nuclear material. Support for a neuronal origin for these \"dense core amyloid plaques\" includes their ability to attract inflammatory cells (microglia and immigrant macrophages) and that they contain nuclear and cytoplasmic components that are somewhat resistant to proteolysis by lysosomes released during neuronal cell lysis. We discuss here the clinical and therapeutic importance of recognizing that amyloid deposition occurs both within neurons (intracellular) and in the interstitial (extracellular) space of the brain. For dense core plaques  we propose that the latter location largely follows from the former. This scenario suggests that blocking intraneuronal amyloid deposition should be a primary therapeutic target. This strategy also would be effective for blocking the gradual compromise of neuronal function resulting from this intraneuronal deposition  and the eventual death and lysis of these amyloid-burdened neurons that leads to amyloid release and the appearance of dense core amyloid plaques in the interstitium of AD brains.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Protein expression of BACE1, BACE2 and APP in Down syndrome brains.Down syndrome (DS) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. The phenotype of DS is thought to result from overexpression of a gene or genes located on the triplicated chromosome or chromosome region. Several reports have shown that the neuropathology of DS comprises developmental abnormalities and Alzheimer-like lesions such as senile plaques. A key component of senile plaques is amyloid beta-peptide which is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential action of beta-secretases (BACE1 and BACE2) and gamma-secretase. While BACE1 maps to chromosome 11  APP and BACE2 are located on chromosome 21. To challenge the gene dosage effect and gain insight into the expressional relation between beta-secretases and APP in DS brain  we evaluated protein expression levels of BACE1  BACE2 and APP in fetal and adult DS brain compared to controls. In fetal brain  protein expression levels of BACE2 and APP were comparable between DS and controls. BACE1 was increased  but did not reach statistical significance. In adult brain  BACE1 and BACE2 were comparable between DS and controls  but APP was significantly increased. We conclude that APP overexpression seems to be absent during the development of DS brain up to 18-19 weeks of gestational age. However  its overexpression in adult DS brain could lead to disturbance of normal function of APP contributing to neurodegeneration. Comparable expression of BACE1 and BACE2 speaks against the hypothesis that increased beta-secretase results in (or even underlies) increased production of amyloidogenic A beta fragments. Furthermore  current data indicate that the DS phenotype cannot be fully explained by simple gene dosage effect.',\n",

We present a comprehensive epidemiological survey on CJD patients in Argentina based on systematic surveillance between 1997 and 2008. METHODS: A CJD Surveillance Referral Center (SRC) was established in Argentina in 1997; previously a Neuropathology Referral Center was used from 1983 to 1996. All suspected cases referred to the SRC were classified using established criteria on the basis of information derived from the following: clinical data form  EEG  MRI (both for central review)  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for protein 14-3-3 Western blot (WB)  autopsy or biopsy material for neuropathology  prion protein (PrP) immunohistochemistry and PrP WB  as well as blood for DNA studies (when brain tissue was not available). RESULTS: Of the 517 patients referred to the SRC between 1997 and 2008  211 (40.8%) had CJD or other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) (definite or probable). Possible cases totaled 14.5%  while cases with no WHO criteria accounted for 16.4%. Non-CJD cases excluded by biopsy/autopsy or during follow-up corresponded to 28.2% of the 517 referrals. Main differential diagnoses included neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease  frontotemporal dementia  vascular  metabolic or viral encephalopathy  and Hashimoto's disease. Five percent of referred patients ultimately recovered. Eighty-three percent of TSE cases were sporadic CJD; 17% were genetic  mainly E200K (15.6%); the remaining 1.4% included an octarepeat insertion and two Gerstmann-Strﾃ､ussler-Scheinker cases (P102L). Seventy-four of 100 definite cases had frozen tissue available for molecular subtyping (PrP(Sc)/codon 129). CSF protein 14-3-3 WB sensitivity was 72.3% and specificity was 92.1%. Clinical diagnostic criteria for probable CJD when compared to definite diagnosis by neuropathology showed 71.3% sensitivity  86.2% specificity  94.4% positive predictive value and 48% negative predictive value. Country incidence increased over time and reached 0.85 cases per million in 2008  with the highest rate detected in the city of Buenos Aires (1.8). Districts with 6% of the total population have never reported suspected cases. CONCLUSION: In spite of an increase in incidence observed over time  the difference between Buenos Aires city  where the incidence is comparable to that of smaller European countries with higher population density  and the incidence observed in the rest of the country suggests underreporting in nonmetropolitan areas  probably due to a lack of access to specialized medical facilities. CSF WB sensitivity results for protein 14-3-3 were probably linked to the fact that testing was not routinely repeated during the course of the disease  when earlier test results had been negative. The spectrum of molecular CJD subtypes observed did not differ from other countries in Europe. No iatrogenic or variant CJD cases were identified. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of clinical diagnostic criteria for probable CJD (which includes EEG and/or CSF protein 14-3-3 levels) may have been resulted from confirmed cases not meeting probable criteria before autopsy  due to a lack of ancillary tests such as EEG and/or CSF 14-3-3 WB  or because negative tests were not repeated during follow-up.\",\n",

The antibody BW 250/183 is an immunoglobulin G1 subtype that binds to the antigen NCA-95  which is expressed on the cell membrane surface of granulocytes. METHODS: We studied 51 patients who were referred with the diagnosis of FUO. Thirty-five percent of the patients suffered from infection  17% had autoimmune diseases  14% had neoplasms and 8% had other diseases. The remaining 28% of the patients did not have a diagnosis. Planar imaging was performed in all patients  and 19 patients underwent SPECT. In our analysis  both cold and hot spots were considered diagnostic. RESULTS: Pyogenic infections were visualized correctly in 13 foci. The diagnosis of endocarditis (n = 4) could be determined only by SPECT. False-negative results were found in 4 patients and false-positive uptake was seen in 2 patients. No false-positive uptake or cold spots in the central bone marrow were found in patients with viral  granulomatous and autoimmune diseases or in those patients in whom no FUO cause was found in a 6-mo follow-up. In these patients  a negative scan did not change their diagnostic work-up. Cold spots in the central bone marrow were correctly interpreted in 5 of 6 patients. Sensitivity in detecting pyogenic foci was 73% and specificity was 97%. Positive and negative predictive values were 93% and 87%  respectively. Including areas of decreased uptake in the analysis  sensitivity for detecting an underlying inflammatory or malignant process for FUO was 81 % and specificity was 87%. Positive and negative predictive values were 81% and 87%  respectively. CONCLUSION: Immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-BW 250/183 in patients with FUO has clinical potential for the diagnosis and exclusion of pyogenic causes of FUO. Metastatic malignant disease and high-grade spondylodiskitis could be diagnosed early in a diagnostic work-up by a characteristic cold spot pattern in the bone marrow.

Method(s): Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at University of New Mexico hospital (UNMH) were screened for development of neurological complications during Feb 01 to April 29, 2020 via retrospective chart review. Result(s): Total of 90 hospitalized patients were screened. Out of seven patients, majority were Native Americans females, and developed neurological complications including subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), Ischemic stroke (IS) and seizure. All 7 patients required Intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. Patients who developed CNS complications other than seizure were females in the younger age group (4 patients, 38-58 years) with poor outcome. Out of 7, three developed subarachnoid hemorrhage, two developed ischemic infarction, and four developed seizure. Two patients with hemorrhagic complication expired during the course of hospitalization. All three patients with seizure were discharged to home. Conclusion(s): Patients with serious CNS complications secondary to COVID-19 infection were observed to be Native Americans. Patients who developed hemorrhagic or ischemic events were observed to have poor outcomes as compared to patients who developed seizures.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"Callosal atrophy in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: different effects in different stages.Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects grey matter (GM). Nevertheless  a number of investigations have documented white matter (WM) pathology associated with AD. The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest WM fiber bundle in the human brain. It has been shown to be susceptible to atrophy in AD mainly as a correlate of Wallerian degeneration of commissural nerve fibers of the neocortex. The aim of this study was to investigate which callosal regions are affected and whether callosal degeneration is associated with the stage of the disease. For this purpose  we analyzed high-resolution MRI data of patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=20)  mild AD (n=20)  severe AD (n=10)  and of healthy controls (n=20). Callosal morphology was investigated applying two different structural techniques: mesh-based geometrical modeling methods and whole-brain voxel-based analyses. Our findings indicate significant reductions in severe AD patients compared to healthy controls in anterior (genu and anterior body) and posterior (splenium) sections. In contrast  differences between healthy controls and mild AD patients or amnesic MCI patients were less pronounced and did not survive corrections for multiple comparisons. When correlating anterior and posterior WM density of the CC with GM density of the cortex in the severe AD group  we detected significant positive relationships between posterior sections of the CC and the cortex. We conclude that callosal atrophy is present predominantly in the latest stage of AD  where two mechanisms might contribute to WM alterations in severe AD: the Wallerian degeneration in posterior subregions and the myelin breakdown process in anterior subregions.\",\n",

This imaging method has conclusively demonstrated that dementing diseases are multifocal  rather than global  brain disorders and has shown that clinically similar dementias may have significantly different patterns of regional glucose metabolism. These observations have helped to focus pathological investigations and provided new insights into disease pathophysiology  yet the diagnostic potential of FDG-PET has not been fully exploited. Now that FDG-PET is becoming widely available to clinicians  it is timely to consider how to evaluate its utility in diagnosing dementing diseases. FDG-PET may be especially valuable in the clinical recognition of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD causes a distinctive pattern of cerebral glucose hypometabolism  but can be difficult to distinguish clinically from more common disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and psychiatric disturbances. Currently available studies primarily evaluate metabolic changes in groups of patients and are inadequate to rely upon when evaluating individuals. Additional carefully designed clinical trials are needed to validate FDG-PET as a diagnostic biomarker.\",\n",

Ulceration is the most common complication in the diabetic forefoot and underlies more than 90% of cases of pedal osteomyelitis. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is  nevertheless  difficult  and imaging is an important part of the work-up. Plain radiographs  although useful for anatomical information  are neither sensitive nor specific. Three-phase bone scintigraphy is sensitive but not specific. Labelled leucocyte scintigraphy and MRI are both useful and are complementary to one another. Labelled leucocyte scintigraphy is valuable for diagnosis as well as follow-up of pedal osteomyelitis. MRI offers exquisite anatomical detail  which is invaluable for guiding surgical management. The principal complication in the mid and hind foot is the neuropathic or Charcot joint. Although infection of the neuropathic joint is infrequent  its diagnosis is difficult. The extensive bony changes that accompany this disorder severely diminish the value of radiography and bone scintigraphy. It is not always possible to distinguish the marrow oedema of neuropathy from that of osteomyelitis and the role of MRI in the evaluation of this entity is still uncertain. Uptake of labelled leucocytes in the absence of infection may occur and is owing  at least in part  to haematopoietically active marrow. Combined leucocyte/marrow scintigraphy holds considerable promise for identifying the infected Charcot joint.',\n",

AIM: The aim was to evaluate the quality of sleep (QoS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), among health care professionals treating patients with COVID-19, as well as quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression and levels of anxiety. METHODS: We included 201 health care professionals in a cross-sectional, web-based study by applying 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, 36-item Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and additional survey constructed for the purpose of the study. RESULTS: Health care workers who treated COVID-19 patients were more afraid of becoming infected or of transmitting the infection to a family member with a significantly low self-assessment of their mental status. Poor QoS and HRQoL correlated with high health anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and several demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher scores on GAD-7 (beta = .71, p < .01) and lower scores on mental health (MH) subscale on SF36 questionnaire (beta = -.69; p < .01) were independent predictors of the higher PSQI score (adjusted R2 = .61, p < .01 for overall model). Higher scores on GAD-7 (beta = .68, p < .01) and worse self-perceived mental status (beta = .25; p < .05) were independent predictors of the lower SF36 scores (adjusted R2 = .73, p < .01 for overall model).

However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/ MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95%CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, 6 studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/ M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95%CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49AU/mL (range: 7.25AU/mL-140.32AU/mL) and 3.79AU/mL (range: 0.16AU/mL-45.83AU/mL), p = 0.0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants. Further studies on transplacental transmission and the magnitude of natural passive immunity in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are warranted. This article is protected by copyright.

The abdominal radiograph remains important for children of all ages when bowel obstruction or perforation is clinically suspected  with the initial reading of this image typically being performed by the duty surgeon in charge of the patient's care. Similarly  in the neonatal unit when an infant develops clinical symptoms and signs of necrotising enterocolitis  a plain radiograph is usually the preliminary imaging investigation  this time with the neonatologist viewing the image prior to the radiologist. Abdominal radiographs are also important for the ward staff to check the position of support apparatus. In many of these situations US can be used as an alternate imaging modality  but trained radiology personnel are not always available everywhere. Fluoroscopy is used to guide diagnostic and therapeutic enemas in neonates with low bowel obstruction  and also to check bowel calibre and integrity post-operatively. In those infants with complex GU and GI abnormalities  fluoroscopy supplements US andMRI to accurately define the anatomy. In the emergency situation  the upper GI contrast study is still the 'gold standard'to investigate children with suspected small bowel malrotation / volvulus. Many units will perform fluoroscopic-guided air reduction of intussusception  too. Urgent but not emergent  are checks of feeding tubes and central vascular catheters following injection of water-soluble contrast medium  when this equipment malfunctions. With respect to the GU tract  fluoroscopy remains the primary modality used for MCUG examinations in many centres.

Environmental attributes (eg  noise  lighting) and direct observations of agitation (primary outcome) were recorded via the Agitation Behavior Mapping Inventory. Engagement was measured using the Observational Measurement of Engagement. Both agitation and engagement were assessed for each stimulus (including a control condition). RESULTS: Univariate findings (ie  for 1 explanatory variable at a time) showed agitation to be related to several personal attributes--ie  female gender was related to verbal agitation (P < .0001); low cognitive function was related to total  verbal  and physical agitation (P < .001 for each); low performance of activities of daily living was significantly related to all types of agitation (P < .01 for total agitation and P < .05 for each type of agitation); and unclear speech was significantly related to total agitation (P < .01). Eight of the 9 stimulus categories were significantly related to decreased levels of agitation  with ORs ranging from 0.37 (live human stimuli  P < .001) to 0.79 (inanimate social stimuli  P < .05). Higher levels of engagement were related to lower levels of agitation (P < .001 for total agitation).

Drug trials using neuroimaging become prohibitively costly if vast numbers of subjects must be assessed  so it is vital to develop efficient measures of brain change. A popular measure of efficiency is the minimal sample size (n80) needed to detect 25% change in a biomarker  with 95% confidence and 80% power. For multivariate measures of brain change  we can directly optimize n80 based on a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Here we use a supervised learning framework to optimize n80  offering two alternative solutions. With a new medial surface modeling method  we track 3D dynamic changes in the lateral ventricles in 2065 ADNI scans. We apply our LDA-based weighting to the results. Our best average n80-in two-fold nested cross-validation-is 104 MCI subjects (95% CI: [94 139]) for a 1-year drug trial  and 75AD subjects [64 102]. This compares favorably with other MRI analysis methods. The standard \"statistical ROI\" approach applied to the same ventricular surfaces requires 165 MCI or 94AD subjects. At 2 years  the best LDA measure needs only 67 MCI and 52AD subjects  versus 119 MCI and 80AD subjects for the stat-ROI method. Our surface-based measures are unbiased: they give no artifactual additive atrophy over three time points.

All patients suspected to have vertebral infection underwent radiologic imaging and In-Biotin scintigraphy. OBJECTIVE: Biotin is a growth factor used by many bacteria. The aim of our study is to use In-Biotin to diagnose vertebral infections. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Magnetic resonance imaging  even if endowed with fairly good sensitivity and specificity  shows some limitations in the study of the onset of pathology and in postsurgical conditions. Conventional scintigraphic imaging  like bone scintigraphy with Tc-MDP  Ga-citrate scintigraphy  or Positron Emission Tomography with [F]FDG  are limited by relatively low specificity; the use of Streptavidin/In-Biotin scintigraphy  based on aspecific uptake of tracer in the site of infection  shows good results in term of sensibility and specificity but the use of heterologous protein might engender immunogenic reactions. METHODS: All patients (pts) (n = 110) of the study underwent In-biotin scintigraphy 2 hours after intravenous injection of the tracer  71 pts were suspected to have hematogenous vertebral infection (Group I) and 39 pts were suspected to have postsurgical infection (Group II). The reference for final diagnosis was either bacterial cultures  histopathologic analysis  and/or clinical/imaging follow-up for at least 1 year. RESULTS: In-biotin scintigraphy showed a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 98% in Group I and a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 84% in Group II. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that In-Biotin scintigraphy possess high diagnostic accuracy. This technique is easy to perform and requires short imaging time-point after intravenous tracer injection. Moreover if In-Biotin uptake is due only to high proliferation rate of bacteria presents in site of infection  it will be further investigated to discriminate definitely bacterial from sterile inflammation.',\n",

Generation of Abeta involves beta-secretase and gamma-secretase activities and is regulated by membrane trafficking of the proteins involved in Abeta production. Here we describe a new small molecule  EHT 1864  which blocks the Rac1 signaling pathways. In vitro  EHT 1864 blocks Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 production but does not impact sAPPalpha levels and does not inhibit beta-secretase. Rather  EHT 1864 modulates APP processing at the level of gamma-secretase to prevent Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 generation. This effect does not result from a direct inhibition of the gamma-secretase activity and is specific for APP cleavage  since EHT 1864 does not affect Notch cleavage. In vivo  EHT 1864 significantly reduces Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 levels in guinea pig brains at a threshold that is compatible with delaying plaque accumulation and/or clearing the existing plaque in brain. EHT 1864 is the first derivative of a new chemical series that consists of candidates for inhibiting Abeta formation in the brain of AD patients.

We simulated the use of widespread serological testing with realistic assay characteristics, in which seropositive individuals partially restore their social contacts and act as immunological shields. If social distancing is relaxed by 50% at the same time that quarterly serological screening is initiated, approximately 120,000 deaths could be averted and a quarter of the US population could be released from social distancing in the first year of the epidemic, compared to a scenario without serological testing.

Patients also underwent DE (n=18) and rest-redistribution Tl(201) tomography (n=16) before revascularization. MCE was performed using continuous Optison infusion (12 to 16 cc/h) with intermittent pulse inversion harmonics and incremental triggering (1:1 to 1:8). Myocardial contrast intensity (MCI) replenishment curves were constructed to derive quantitative MCE indices of blood velocity and flow. Recovery of function occurred in 38% of dysfunctional segments. MCE parameters of perfusion in hibernating myocardium were similar to segments with normal function and higher than dysfunctional myocardium without recovery of function (P<0.001). The best MCE parameter for predicting functional recovery was Peak MCIxbeta  an index of myocardial blood flow (area under the curve  0.83). MCE parameters were higher in segments with contractile reserve and Tl(201) uptake > or =60% (P<0.05) and identified viable segments without contractile reserve by DE. The sensitivity of Peak MCIxbeta >1.5 dB/s for recovery of function was 90% and was similar to Tl(201) scintigraphy (92%) and any contractile reserve (80%); specificity was higher than for Tl(201) and DE (63%  45%  and 54%  respectively; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCE with intravenous contrast identifies myocardial hibernation in humans. Prediction of viable myocardium with MCE is best using quantification of myocardial blood flow and provides improved accuracy compared with DE and Tl(201) scintigraphy.',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"Diagnostic accuracy and safety of inhalation challenge tests for bird fancier's lung-Systematic review and meta-analysisOBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of inhalation challenge tests for bird fancier's lung and related adverse reactions. DESIGN: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for the diagnostic test accuracy of inhalation challenge tests and a systematic review for adverse events of the tests. We evaluated the risk of bias and applicability of the included articles for diagnostic test accuracy with the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We used hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve analysis to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of challenge tests and assessed subjective adverse reactions and steroid treatment use. Sensitivity was calculated by fixing specificity at 99% from the HSROC curve. DATA SOURCES: We searched for articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of inhalation challenge tests or describing adverse reactions in Medline  Embase  the Cochrane Library  the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  and Web of Science. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included randomized control trials  prospective or retrospective cohort studies  or case-control studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of inhalation challenge tests for bird fancier's lung. For adverse effects review  we included the same articles  and case series or case reports reporting adverse reactions of inhalation challenge tests. RESULTS: In our review of 12 articles  the diagnostic accuracy of inhalation challenge tests was substantially high. Point estimate of sensitivity when calculated with a fixed specificity of 99% was 99%. Among 873 patients  6 needed steroid treatment for adverse reactions; however  no death occurred due to acute exacerbation following a challenge test. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation challenges for bird fancier's lung could be accurate and safe diagnostic procedures and may be considered both as rule-in and rule-out tests in tertiary care centres. However  caution is required regarding overestimation of diagnostic yield due to risk of bias.

Polymers of tau protein can also be found in other neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau is a highly soluble protein  intrinsically devoid of secondary or tertiary structure  as many others proteins particularly prone to form fibrillar aggregations. The mechanism by which this unfolded molecule evolves to the well ordered helical filaments has been amply studied. In fact  it is a very slow process when followed in the absence of aggregation inducers. Herein we describe the use of surface plasmon resonance  atomic force microscopy  and atomic force spectroscopy to detect tau-tau interactions and to follow the process of aggregation in the absence of aggregation inducers. Tau-tau interactions are clearly detected  although a very long period of time is needed to observe filaments formation. Tau oligomers showing a granular appearance  however  are observed immediately as a consequence of this interaction. These granular tau oligomers slowly evolve to larger structures and eventually to filaments having a size smaller than those reported for paired helical filaments purified from Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

Among the complications of inflammatory bowel diseases, such eventuality is quite unusual. Ulcerative colitis accounts for the majority of these vascular complications, while in Crohn's disease the occurrence of such events is exceptional. We present the case of a young male patient aged 42, without any particular history, in whom the diagnosis of the first flare of colonic Crohn's disease was accompanied by the discovery of a portal cavernoma, followed by the demonstration of a heterozygous mutation factor V Leiden associated with the presence of an antiphospholipid syndrome with IgG anticardiolipin antibodies.

Lrrk2 is a phylogenetically conserved  ubiquitous protein  which is constitutively expressed in various cells including neurons and glial cells of human brain. We recently reported that Lrrk2 is identified in Lewy bodies in PD as well as in neuronal and glial inclusions in several other neurodegenerative disorders. Here we show that Lrrk2 is closely associated with the tau-positive inclusions in eight members of a family with frontotemporal dementia of the pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration type linked to the chromosome 17 N279K tau mutation (N279K/FTDP-17/PPND). Lrrk2 is colocalized with tau in oligodendroglial coiled bodies and intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions. HLA-DR positive reactive microglia and ICAM-1 positive reactive astrocytes accumulated in affected areas demonstrating that inflammatory processes are also involved in the disease pathogenesis. Western blot analysis of soluble extracts of N279K/FTDP-17/PPND brain tissue suggests that C-terminal fragment(s) of apparent 64-75 kDa molecular weight may be the major Lrrk2 species in pathological deposits. The possibility that Lrrk2 is linked with various neurodegenerative disorders through the ubiquitin proteosome pathway is discussed. The results indicate that Lrrk2 is linked to frontotemporal atrophy of PPND type caused by N279K tau mutation.

       "  {'feature': \"The First 60 Days: Physical Therapy in a Neurosurgical Center Converted Into a COVID-19 Center in BrazilOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report was to describe the role of physical therapists in a neurosurgical center that was converted into a COVID-19 center for critically ill patients. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): On March 16, 2020, the state government of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, determined that a neurosurgical center with 44 ICU beds equipped with mechanical ventilators should immediately transfer all patients with neurological conditions to other institutions and prepare for patients who were critically ill with COVID-19. The staff, including physical therapists, were trained to handle patients with COVID-19, many of whom were developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with complex and multifactorial ventilatory support needs. Adjustments were made to the physical therapy routine and protocols. Following the stabilization of patients' respiratory condition, physical therapist interventions focused on restoring physical function. RESULTS: A total of 116 confirmed COVID-19 cases were treated from March 17 to May 17, 2020. Sixty percent were men (70) and 40% were women (46), with a median age of 59 years. Eighty-nine percent (103) underwent mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, of which 11% (11) were successfully extubated. Thirty percent (31) of patients underwent tracheostomy, and 26% of those (8) were successfully decannulated. Of the total patients, 57 patients died (mortality rate of 49%), 4 (3%) were transferred to another institution, 23 (20%) were discharged home, and 32 (28%) continued to be hospitalized. CONCLUSION: Physical therapists in the ICU can facilitate care for critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training. IMPACT: The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of physical therapists, specifically in the care of patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. The availability and expertise of physical therapists in the ICU are important for managing critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training.

Procedures: Fifteen patients with brain glioma referred to initial diagnosis were examined with ACE  MET  and FDG-PET. Five patients had low-grade gliomas (grade II)  three had anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III)  and seven had glioblastomas (grade IV). PET results were evaluated by visual and semiquantitative analysis. For semiquantitative analysis  the standardized uptake value (SUV) and tumor to contralateral normal gray matter (T/N) ratio were calculated. The sensitivity for detection of high-grade gliomas was calculated using visual analysis. Results: Sensitivities of ACE  MET  and FDG were 90%  100%  and 40%  respectively. ACE and MET T/N ratios were significantly higher than that of FDG. ACE and FDG SUV in high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than that in low-grade gliomas. No significant differences were observed using MET. Conclusions: ACE PET is a potentially useful radiotracer for detecting brain gliomas and differentiating high-grade gliomas. ﾂｩ Academy of Molecular Imaging 2008',\n",

We contrast these affinities with HLA allele frequencies across hundreds of human populations worldwide. Statistical modelling shows that peptide-binding affinities classified into four distinct categories depend on the HLA locus but that the type of virus is only a weak predictor, except in the case of HIV-1. Among the strong HLA binders (IC50 <= 50), we uncovered 16 alleles (the top ones being A*02:02, B*15:03 and DRB1*01:02) binding more than 1% of peptides derived from all viruses, 9 (top ones including HLA-A*68:01, B*15:25, C*03:02 and DRB1*07:01) binding all viruses except HIV-1, and 15 (top ones A*02:01 and C*14:02) only binding coronaviruses. The frequencies of strongest and weakest HLA peptide binders differ significantly among populations from different geographic regions. In particular, Indigenous peoples of America show both higher frequencies of strongest and lower frequencies of weakest HLA binders. As many HLA proteins are found to be strong binders of peptides derived from distinct viral families, and are hence promiscuous (or generalist), we discuss this result in relation to possible signatures of natural selection on HLA promiscuous alleles due to past pathogenic infections. Our findings are highly relevant for both evolutionary genetics and the development of vaccine therapies. However they should not lead to forget that individual resistance and vulnerability to diseases go beyond the sole HLA allelic affinity and depend on multiple, complex and often unknown biological, environmental and other variables.Copyright Â© 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Planar imaging helps to localize hot nodes but lacks accuracy of the anatomic location of those nodes. In this study  we compared SPECT-CT to planar LSG in endometrial and cervical cancer to assess its ability to localize SLN. METHODS: We conducted a prospective nonrandomized study of SLN mapping in women with endometrial and cervical cancer. Forty patients with endometrial cancer and 10 with cervical cancer underwent pre-operative LSG with 1 or 4 mCi of (99m)Tc sulfur colloid administered as injections into the cervix. All patients were scanned immediately with planar LSG obtained in the anterior and lateral views. SPECT-CT imaging was obtained following the planar imaging. RESULTS: Planar LSG alone localized SLN in 30/40 (75%) endometrial cancer patients while SPECT-CT localized SLN in all 40 patients (100%). In the 10 cases where SLN was not identified with planar imaging  SPECT-CT localized nodes in the external iliac  internal iliac  common iliac and obturator groups. In cervical cancer  planar LSG alone localized sentinel lymph nodes in 8/10 patients (80%) as compared to SPECT-CT  which localized nodes in all 10 patients (100%). SPECT-CT imaging was especially useful in delineating external iliac versus internal iliac or obturator nodes  and the parametrial nodal uptake.

Our research group initiated a study to ascertain the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of Jordanians toward COVID-19 prior to any initial case report in Jordan. This project was underway when the first Jordanian case was reported. We extended our study to identify how case reporting would alter public KAP towards COVID-19. This cross-sectional study randomly selected and recruited 2104 Jordanian adults. A four-section questionnaire was devised to address the sociodemographic characteristics of the subjects and their KAP toward COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for the study population was 15.9 +/- 2.2 (out of the 20 knowledge questions), with 60.9% of the participants having good knowledge about COVID-19. Participants ' practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19 were adequate in more than 60% of participants. Most participants had positive attitudes regarding their role in preventing COVID-19 and many of the participants' attitudes and practices changed to more appropriate ones after reporting the first case of COVID-19 in Jordan. The percentage of participants who trust the government in confronting COVID-19 increased significantly (p value < 0.001). However, one alarming and unexpected finding was that the prevention practice score of participants working in the medical field was similar to those from the general population. This may necessitate stricter training and guidelines for this group who will be in the frontline in combating the disease. Impact of this study: The data generated from this study shows that when cases of disease were reported, the public's attitudes and practices improved in many aspects, and that confidence in the government to contain the disease was boosted. We believe that this study is important in allowing other, international governments to develop an understanding of public KAP during pandemic disease outbreaks.\",\n",

Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, DELTA = 5, P < .001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, DELTA = 9, P < .001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, DELTA = 3, P = .001). Conclusion Artificial intelligence assistance improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from non-coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia at chest CT.

       "  {'feature': 'Voxel-based analysis of diffusion tensor imaging in patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment: correlates with cognitive and motor deficits.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with small vessel disease show high-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images that represent ischemic cell damage. However  despite a similar degree of ischemic change  the amount and the severity of clinical presentations may vary. We investigated the clinical correlations of ischemic changes using voxel-based morphometric analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Twenty-seven MCI and 34 dementia patients were included who all had significant small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all patients  neuropsychological tests  a rating on the Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal scale (PEPS) for motor deficits  and 3-Tesla MRI including DTI scans were performed. Voxel-based analysis of the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were computed. RESULTS: Cognitive scores correlated with the DTI abnormalities in supratentorial areas with regional specificity according to each cognitive test. Unexpectedly  cognitive deficits in most neuropsychological tests  even in some frontal tasks  were associated with disruption of posterior white matter integrities. Motor deficits correlated with both supra- and infratentorial lesions. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in patients with small vessel disease who show cognitive and motor impairments  a specific distribution of fiber tract damage is more related with clinical deficits than is the severity of the total ischemia.',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"An automated algorithm for the computation of brain volume change from sequential MRIs using an iterative principal component analysis and its evaluation for the assessment of whole-brain atrophy rates in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease.This article introduces an automated method for the computation of changes in brain volume from sequential magnetic resonance images (MRIs) using an iterative principal component analysis (IPCA) and demonstrates its ability to characterize whole-brain atrophy rates in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The IPCA considers the voxel intensity pairs from coregistered MRIs and identifies those pairs a sufficiently large distance away from the iteratively determined PCA major axis. Analyses of simulated and real MRI data support the underlying assumption of a linear relationship in paired voxel intensities  identify an outlier distance threshold that optimizes the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in the detection of small volume changes while accounting for global intensity changes  and demonstrate an ability to detect changes as small as 0.04% of brain volume without confounding effects of between-scan shifts in voxel intensity. In eight patients with probable AD and eight age-matched normal control subjects  the IPCA was comparable to the established but partly manual digital subtraction (DS) method in characterizing annual rates of whole-brain atrophy: resulting rates were correlated (Spearman rank correlation = 0.94  P < 0.0005) and comparable in distinguishing probable AD from normal aging (IPCA-detected atrophy rates: 2.17 +/- 0.52% per year in the patients vs. 0.41 +/- 0.22% per year in the controls [Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test P = 7.8 x 10(-4)]; DS-detected atrophy rates: 3.51 +/- 1.31% per year in the patients vs. 0.48 +/- 0.29% per year in the controls [P = 7.8 x 10(-4)]). The IPCA could be used in tracking the progression of AD  evaluating the disease-modifying effects of putative treatments  and investigating the course of other normal and pathological changes in brain morphology.\",\n",

This study aimed to describe patient, family member and potential donor perspectives on the suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programs due to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted seven online focus groups involving 31 adult kidney transplant candidates (n=22), caregivers (n=4) and potential donors (n=5). Transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: We identified five themes: cascading disappointments and devastation (with subthemes of shattering hope, succumbing to defeat, regret and guilt); helplessness and vulnerability (fear of declining health, confronted by the threat of and change in dialysis, disconnected from healthcare, susceptibility to infective complications); stress from uncertainty (confusion from conflicting information, unable to forward plan), exacerbating burdens (incurring extra financial costs, intensifying caregiver responsibilities), and sustaining health through the delay (protecting eligibility, relying on social support, adapting to emerging modalities of care). CONCLUSIONS: During the suspension of kidney transplantation programs, patients felt medically vulnerable because of declining health, susceptibility to infection and reduced access to care. There is a need to address health vulnerabilities, disappointment, uncertainty and additional burdens arising from the suspension of kidney transplantation programs.

Methods: A total of 37 overseas young and middle-aged people, who tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive upon their return to Shanghai, were enrolled for an analysis of their clinical symptoms, blood routine indexes, and lung CT images. Results: The clinical symptoms were characterized by fever (51.4%), dry cough (13.5%), expectoration (27.0%), hypodynamia (21.6%), pharyngalia (10.8%), pharynoxerosis (8.1%), rhinobyon (13.5%), rhinorrhea (8.1%), muscular soreness (16.2%), and diarrhea (2.7%). In 16.2% of cases, no symptoms were reported. Fever was the most common symptom (51.40%). The pneumonic changes referred to the latticed ground glass imaging and similar white lung imaging accompanied by consolidated shadows. The rate of pneumonia was high (81.10%). We found that the exclusive percent of eosinophils was abnormally low. By analyzing the correlation of eosinophils, fever, and pneumonia, we found that the percentage of eosinophils was low in the COVID-19 patients afflicted with fever or pneumonia (P < 0.01). Additionally, pneumonia and fever were negatively correlated with the percentage of eosinophils and eosinophils/neutrophils ratio (P < 0.01, respectively), but not associated with pneumonia severity (P > 0.05). Fever was not correlated with pneumonia (P > 0.05). Conclusion: A low percentage of eosinophils may be considered as a biomarker of pneumonia of COVID-19, but not as a biomarker of pneumonia severity.

We experienced a similar phenomenon in the treatment of malignant gliomas and meningiomas using boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT)  a cell-selective form of particle radiation. Here  we introduce representative cases and analyze the pathogenesis. Fifty-two cases of malignant glioma and 13 cases of malignant meningioma who were treated by BNCT were reviewed retrospectively mainly via MR images. Eleven of 52 malignant gliomas and 3 of 13 malignant meningiomas showed transient increases of enhanced volume in MR images within 3 months after BNCT. Among these cases  five patients with glioma underwent surgery because of suspicion of relapse. In histology  most of the specimens showed necrosis with small amounts of residual tumor cells. Ki-67 labeling showed decreased positivity compared with previous samples from the individuals. Fluoride-labeled boronophenylalanine PET was applied in four and two cases of malignant gliomas and meningiomas  respectively  at the time of transient increase of lesions. These PET scans showed decreased lesion:normal brain ratios in all cases compared with scans obtained prior to BNCT. With or without surgery  all lesions were decreased or stable in size during observation. Transient increases in enhanced volume in malignant gliomas and meningiomas immediately after BNCT seemed to be pseudoprogression. This pathogenesis was considered as treatment-related intratumoral necrosis in the subacute phase after BNCT. Copyright 2009 by the Society for Neuro-Oncology.',\n",

The positrons emitted by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG  travelling into tissues faster than the speed of light in the same medium  are responsible for Cerenkov radiation (CR) emission which is prevalently in the visible range. The purpose of this study is to show that CR escaping from tumour tissues of small living animals injected with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG can be detected with optical imaging (OI) techniques using a commercial optical instrument equipped with charge-coupled detectors (CCD). Methods: The theory behind the Cerenkov light emission and the source depth measurements using CR is first presented. Mice injected with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG or saline solution underwent dynamic OI acquisition and a comparison between images was performed. Multispectral analysis of the radiation was used to estimate the depth of the source of Cerenkov light. Small animal PET images were also acquired in order to compare the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG bio-distribution measured using OI and PET scanner. Results: Cerenkov in vivo whole-body images of tumour-bearing mice and the measurements of the emission spectrum (560-660\\xa0nm range) are presented. Brain  kidneys and tumour were identified as a source of visible light in the animal body: the tissue time-activity curves reflected the physiological accumulation of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in these organs. The identification is confirmed by the comparison between CR and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG images. Conclusion: These results will allow the use of conventional OI devices for the in vivo study of glucose metabolism in cancer and the assessment  for example  of anti-cancer drugs.

We report on a South African family that presented with progressive dementia and a movement disorder affecting numerous family members. Genotyping of the JPH3 CTG repeat revealed pathogenic expansions in three affected individuals.

Moreover  brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of these patients showed imaging features atypical for HD. Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA analysis on a family member showed that his maternal and paternal ancestries are typical of that found among the South African mixed ancestry or colored population.

Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may help clinicians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs). Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised using GRADEpro. Eighteen articles (5 RCTs, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 11 retrospective cohort studies) involving 4,941 patients were included. Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I2 = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I2 = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68). The lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination showed superior virological eradication and radiographical improvement with reduced rate of ARDS. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result. For safety, ribavirin could induce more bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis. Meanwhile, hydroxychloroquine could increase AEs rate especially diarrhea. Overall, the quality of evidence on most outcomes were very low. In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles. Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents. Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia. Thus, large RCTs objectively assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections should be conducted with high priority. Copyright Â© 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.',\n",

The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: : The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: : Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation & conclusions: : Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.\",\n",

He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any \"normal\" post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

Results of an Online SurveyBackgroud: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally affecting all strata of people including the orthopaedic surgeons of India. We have witnessed a drastic fall in the number of patients. The aim of study was to assess the extent to which the Indian orthopaedic practice has been affected by the pandemic. Methods: We conducted an online survey amongst currently practicing Indian orthopaedic surgeons. Those currently not in practice or under training or having left clinical practice before the onset of pandemic were excluded. A total of 533 orthopaedic surgeons took part in the study amongst which, complete responses were obtained from 407 individuals. Statistical analysis was done to see the association between demographic profile of study participants and various variables of orthopaedic practice. Results: There was drastic fall in all the parameters of orthopaedic practice. Over half of the practicing surgeons witnessed fall in out-patients over 90%. Most had stopped elective surgeries (64%) and even emergency ones (21%) altogether. More than 50% of doctors had their earnings reduced by > 75%. We found a statistically highly significant association of reduction in earnings with the sector, type of set-up and duration of practice. (p-value < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that orthopaedic surgeons across all sectors in different kinds of set-ups have been affected in their out-patient and operative numbers. With regards to earnings, those working in private and running their own (individual) hospitals & clinics have been most severely affected while those in government sector and medical colleges have been affected the least.

Existing studies evaluated image registration algorithms in specific tasks or using specific databases (e.g.  only for skull-stripped images  only for single-site images  etc.). Consequently  the choice of registration algorithms seems task- and usage/parameter-dependent. Nevertheless  recent large-scale  often multi-institutional imaging-related studies create the need and raise the question whether some registration algorithms can 1) generally apply to various tasks/databases posing various challenges; 2) perform consistently well  and while doing so  3) require minimal or ideally no parameter tuning. In seeking answers to this question  we evaluated 12 general-purpose registration algorithms  for their generality  accuracy and robustness. We fixed their parameters at values suggested by algorithm developers as reported in the literature. We tested them in 7 databases/tasks  which present one or more of 4 commonly-encountered challenges: 1) inter-subject anatomical variability in skull-stripped images; 2) intensity homogeneity  noise and large structural differences in raw images; 3) imaging protocol and field-of-view (FOV) differences in multi-site data; and 4) missing correspondences in pathology-bearing images. Totally 7 562 registrations were performed. Registration accuracies were measured by (multi-)expert-annotated landmarks or regions of interest (ROIs). To ensure reproducibility  we used public software tools  public databases (whenever possible)  and we fully disclose the parameter settings. We show evaluation results  and discuss the performances in light of algorithms' similarity metrics  transformation models and optimization strategies. We also discuss future directions for the algorithm development and evaluations.\",\n",

METHODS: A 58-item electronic survey was distributed to pregnant and postpartum women (infants <12 months) who were >15 years, English-speaking and enrolled in prenatal programs. Data is summarized using central tendency, frequencies and nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Of 114 (51 % response rate) participants, 82.5 % reported negative changes in mental status measures (e.g. stress, anxious thoughts, changes in sleep patterns). All reported risk-reduction behavior changes (e.g. handwashing/use of sanitizer, social distancing). Significant changes were reported in employment and financial status due to the pandemic. Increases in alcohol consumption among postpartum women were also reported. Few reported changes in prenatal, infant or postpartum healthcare access. CONCLUSION: This study provides initial insight into the knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is limited as participants represent a single Midwest community and social desirability response bias may have impacted responses.

Patients with evidence of progressive disease after 24 h including an oxygen saturation <93% at rest in ambient air were included at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland in April 2020. Conestat alfa was administered by intravenous injections of 8400 IU followed by 3 additional doses of 4200 IU in 12-h intervals. Five patients (age range, 53-85 years; one woman) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (11-39% lung involvement on computed tomography scan of the chest) were treated a median of 1 day (range 1-7 days) after admission. Treatment was well-tolerated. Immediate defervescence occurred, and inflammatory markers and oxygen supplementation decreased or stabilized in 4 patients (e.g., median C-reactive protein 203 (range 31-235) mg/L before vs. 32 (12-72) mg/L on day 5). Only one patient required mechanical ventilation. All patients recovered. C1INH concentrations were elevated before conestat alfa treatment. Levels of complement activation products declined after treatment. Viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs declined in 4 patients. In this uncontrolled case series, targeting multiple inflammatory cascades by conestat alfa was safe and associated with clinical improvements in the majority of severe COVID-19 patients. Controlled clinical trials are needed to assess its safety and efficacy in preventing disease progression.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Urwyler, Moser, Charitos, Heijnen, Rudin, Sommer, Giannetti, Bassetti, Sendi, Trendelenburg and Osthoff.',\n",

METHODS: We included 21 patients with FTD  24 patients with AD  and 25 CN subjects in this cross-sectional MRI study. All subjects had MRI scans including T1-weighted structural images and ASL-MR images. RESULTS: ASL-MRI detected a pattern of hypoperfusion in right frontal regions in patients with FTD vs CN subjects  similar to PET and SPECT. FTD had higher perfusion than AD in the parietal regions and posterior cingulate. Frontal hypoperfusion in FTD correlated with deficits in judgment and problem solving. Adding frontal perfusion to gray matter (GM) atrophy significantly improved the classification of FTD from normal aging to 74%  and adding parietal perfusion to GM atrophy significantly improved the classification of FTD from AD to 75%. Combining frontal and parietal lobe perfusion further improved the classification of FTD from AD to 87%.

The present study investigated the effect of LIG on AD-like cognitive impairment and neuropathological and neuroinflammatory changes induced by bilateral intracerebroventricular injections of Abeta(25-35) at a dose of 50 nmol/rat. Rats received oral administration of 40 mg/kg LIG or volume-matched vehicle 1 h before Abeta(25-35) treatment then once daily for 15 days. Morris water maze was used to detect the cognitive dysfunction induced by Abeta(25-35).

We aimed to determine the cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution at each time point, to explore the relevant affecting factors, and to describe the chest CT findings at different time points after hospital discharge. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR who were discharged consecutively from the hospital between 5 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 and who underwent serial chest CT scans on schedule were enrolled. The radiological characteristics of all patients were collected and analysed. The total CT score was the sum of non-GGO involvement determined at discharge. Afterwards, all patients underwent chest CT scans during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks after discharge. Imaging features and distributions were analysed across different time points. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients who completed all CT scans were evaluated; there were 67 (45.0%) men and 82 (55.0%) women, with a median age of 43 years old (IQR 36-56). The cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution was 8.1% (12 patients), 41.6% (62), 50.3% (75), and 53.0% (79) at discharge and during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks after discharge, respectively. Patients <=44 years old showed a significantly higher cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution than patients > 44 years old at the 3-week follow-up. The predominant patterns of abnormalities observed at discharge were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (125 [83.9%]), fibrous stripe (81 [54.4%]), and thickening of the adjacent pleura (33 [22.1%]). The positive count of GGO, fibrous stripe and thickening of the adjacent pleura gradually decreased, while GGO and fibrous stripe showed obvious resolution during the first week and the third week after discharge, respectively. \"Tinted\" sign and bronchovascular bundle distortion as two special features were discovered during the evolution.

Daylight photodynamic therapy (dPDT) is an effective and patient preferred treatment that uses sunlight to clear AK. Currently, there is no standardised method for measuring the light received during treatment. METHODS: SmartPDT R is a smartphone-based application and web-portal, developed by siHealth Ltd, enabling remote delivery of dPDT. It uses satellite imagery and computational algorithms to provide real-time determination of exposure to PpIX-effective solar radiation (\"light dose\"). The application also provides forecast of expected radiant exposures for 24- and 48 -hs prior to the treatment period. Validation of the real-time and forecasted radiant exposure algorithms was performed against direct ground-based measurement under all weather conditions in Chilton, UK. RESULTS: Agreement between direct ground measurements and satellite-determined radiant exposure for 2 -h treatment was excellent at -0.1% +/- 5.1% (mean +/- standard deviation). There was also excellent agreement between weather forecasted radiant exposure and ground measurement, 1.8% +/- 17.7% at 24 -hs and 1.6% +/- 25.2% at 48 -hs. Relative Root Mean Square of the Error (RMSEr) demonstrated that agreement improved as time to treatment reduced (RMSEr = 22.5% (48 -hs), 11.2% (24 -hs), 5.2% (real-time)). CONCLUSION: Agreement between satellite-determined, weather-forecasted and ground-measured radiant exposure was better than any existing published literature for dPDT.

Our primary aim was to determine if relative bowel wall perfusion measurements correlate with histopathological scores for inflammation or fibrosis in CD.     Methods: A total of 25 patients were investigated before elective surgery for small intestinal CD. Unenhanced ultrasonography [US] and magnetic resonance enterography [MRE] were applied to describe bowel wall thickness. Perfusion was assessed with contrast-enhanced US [CEUS] and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRE [DCE-MRE]. Histopathology was used as gold standard.     Results: Compared with histopathology, the mean wall thickness was 0.4 mm greater on US [range -0.3 to 1.0, p = 0.24] and 1.4 mm greater on MR [0.4 to 2.3, p = 0.006]. No correlation was found between the severity of inflammation or fibrosis on histopathology, and either DCE-MRE [r = -0.13, p = 0.54 for inflammation and r = 0.41, p = 0.05 for fibrosis] or CEUS [r = 0.16, p = 0.45 for inflammation and r = -0.28, p = 0.19 for fibrosis].

In addition to evaluating 131I-tetracycline as an abscess scanning agent  we hoped to obtain data which might clarify the controversy regarding early versus late gallium scanning in suspected infection. 131I-tetracycline was chosen over 99mTc-tetracycline because the longer half-life of 131I would allow 72 hour imaging. Absolute concentrations of gallium in the abscess contents and in the surrounding areas of inflammation were significantly greater than the concentration of 131I-tetracycline at both 24 and 72 hours. With the exception of blood  muscle  and bone  the abscess-to-tissue activity ratios for gallium and 131I-tetracycline were similar; however  the ratio of gallium activity in the inflammed tissue to other tissues was greater than that of 131I-tetracycline for every tissue examined at both time periods. The data suggest that 131I-tetracycline has little potential as a general abscess scanning agent. The gallium tissue concentrations and tissue ratios suggest that abscesses which can be imaged at 72 hours can probably be imaged at 24 hours  thus allowing earlier initiation of appropriate therapy. Because of the higher lesion-to-blood ratio at 72 hours  a 72-hour scan would appear to be indicated before a scan is interpreted as normal.',\n",

However  even with advances in MR imaging and analysis  the correspondence between lesion location and clinical deficit remains poorly understood. Here  structural and diffusion images from 14 healthy subjects are used to create spatially unbiased white matter connectivity importance maps that quantify the amount of disruption to the overall brain network that would be incurred if that region were compromised. Some regions in the white matter that were identified as highly important by such maps have been implicated in strategic infarct dementia and linked to various attention tasks in previous studies. Validation of the maps is performed by investigating the correlations of the importance maps' predicted cognitive deficits in a group of 15 traumatic brain injury patients with their cognitive test scores measuring attention and memory. While no correlation was found between amount of white matter injury and cognitive test scores  significant correlations (r>0.68  p<0.006) were found when including location information contained in the importance maps. These tools could be used by physicians to improve surgical planning  diagnosis  and assessment of disease severity in a variety of pathologies like multiple sclerosis  trauma  and stroke.\",\n",

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the negative pressure isolation stretcher (NPIS) and additional negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) on the maintenance of emergency care capacity during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A before and after intervention study was performed between February 27, 2020 and March 31, 2020 at the ED of Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, South Korea. A total of 2455 patients who visited the ED during the study period were included. Interventions included the introduction of the NPIS and additional NPIRs in the ED. The main outcome of the study was frequency of medical cessation. Secondary outcomes were the average number of ED visits and lengths of stay. RESULTS: After the intervention, average frequency of medical cessation was significantly decreased from 1.6 times per day (range 0-4) in the pre-intervention period to 0.6 times per day (range 0-3) in the post-intervention period (p-value <0.01). On the other hand, the number of patients visiting the ED increased significantly from 67.2 persons per day (range 58-79) pre-intervention to 76.3 persons per day (range 61-88) post-intervention (p value <0.01). However, there were no statistically significant differences in the average ED length of stay across the study phases (p value = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: This intervention may provide an effective way to prepare and meet the ED response needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.',\n",

This study investigated possible relationships between anti-hypertensive medications use and COVID-19 infection risk in the ambulatory hypertensive population. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study involving 34 936 hypertensive adults >50 years in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain) who were retrospectively followed through pandemic period (from 01/03/2020 to 30/04/2020). Two data sets including demographic/clinical characteristics (comorbidities and cardiovascular medications use) and laboratory PCR codes for COVID-19 were linked to construct an anonymized research database. Cox regression was used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and estimate the risk of suffering COVID-19 infection. Across study period, 205 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were observed, which means an overall incidence of 586.8 cases per 100 000 persons-period. In multivariable analyses, only age (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05; P < .001) and nursing home residence (HR: 19.60; 95% CI: 13.80-27.84; P < .001) appeared significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19.

However  an active vaccination strategy based on full length Aﾎｲ42 is currently hampered by elicitation of T cell pathological autoreactivity. We attempt to improve vaccine efficacy by creating a novel chimeric flu vaccine expressing the small immunodominant B cell epitope of Aﾎｲ42. We hypothesized that in elderly people with pre-existing memory Th cells specific to influenza this dual vaccine will simultaneously boost anti-influenza immunity and induce production of therapeutically active anti-Aﾎｲ antibodies. METHODS: Plasmid-based reverse genetics system was used for the rescue of recombinant influenza virus containing immunodominant B cell epitopes of Aﾎｲ42 (Aﾎｲ1-7/10). RESULTS: Two chimeric flu viruses expressing either 7 or 10 aa of Aﾎｲ42 (flu-Aﾎｲ1-7 or flu-Aﾎｲ1-10) were generated and tested in mice as conventional inactivated vaccines. We demonstrated that this dual vaccine induced therapeutically potent anti-Aﾎｲ antibodies and anti-influenza antibodies in mice.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether tumor clearance of Tc-99m MIBI may have a predictive value in the clinical outcome in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. METHODS: Seventeen patients with histologically proved non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy before starting chemotherapy. Early and late images were obtained after the injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) Tc-99m MIBI. Tumor-to-normal soft tissue ratios were measured on early and late images  and the percentage retention (%R) was calculated. These findings were correlated with other prognostic factors. RESULTS: Of all 40 tumor lesions  22 (55%) showed Tc-99m MIBI tumor uptake  whereas the other 18 (45%) lesions had no uptake. According to the location  the diagnostic accuracy of Tc-99m MIBI scans was 66.7% (12 of 18) for lesions of the head and neck  66.7% (8 of 12) for those of the chest  and 20% (2 of 10) for those of subdiaphragmatic regions (P = 0.037). The mean %R of complete responders was 91.8 +/- 14.8% and for partial responders or nonresponders it was 65.4 +/- 17.7% (P = 0.014). The %R of Tc-99m MIBI showed a significant negative correlation with the serum lactate dehydrogenase level (r = -0.757)  the score of the international prognostic index (r = -0.643)  and the Ann Arbor stage (r = -0.733).

Diagnosis of bvFTD is based on informant report  however a number of individuals with a clinical profile consistent with the disease have no imaging abnormality and seem to remain stable  with doubt about the presence of underlying neurodegenerative pathology. We aimed to quantify aspects of the behavioural disorder and link it to the underlying level of atrophy in socially relevant brain regions. We tested individuals with either bvFTD (N = 26) or Alzheimer's disease (N = 9) and 16 controls using The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) to assess their ability to identify emotion and sarcasm in video vignettes. A subset of bvFTD patients (N = 21) and controls (N = 12) were scanned using MRI within 6 months of assessment. There was marked impairment in the ability of bvFTD patients whose scans showed abnormalities to recognize sarcastic  but not sincere statements. Their capacity to interpret negative emotion was also impaired  and this appeared to be a major factor underlying the deficit in sarcasm recognition. Clinically diagnosed bvFTD patients whose scans were normal  Alzheimer's disease patients and controls had no difficulty in appreciating both types of statement. In a multivariate imaging analysis it was shown that the sarcasm (and emotion recognition) deficit was dependent on a circuit involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex  insula  amygdala and temporal pole  particularly on the right. Performance on a more global test of cognitive function  the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination did not have a unique association with these regions. The TASIT is an objective test of social dysfunction in bvFTD which indexes the frontotemporal volume loss in bvFTD patients and provides an objective measure for separating behavioural patients who are likely to decline from those who may remain stable. These results provide additional evidence for the role of the orbitofrontal cortex and related structures in the processing of socially relevant signals  particularly those where negative emotion recognition is important.\",\n",

Patients with AD have cerebrovascular alterations attributable to the deleterious effects of Abeta on cerebral blood vessels. We report here that NADPH oxidase  the major source of free radicals in blood vessels  is responsible for the cerebrovascular dysregulation induced by Abeta. Thus  the free-radical production and the associated alterations in vasoregulation induced by Abeta are abrogated by the NADPH oxidase peptide inhibitor gp91ds-tat and are not observed in mice lacking the catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase (gp91phox). Furthermore  oxidative stress and cerebrovascular dysfunction do not occur in transgenic mice overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein but lacking gp91phox. The mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase-derived radicals mediate the cerebrovascular dysfunction involve reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide. Thus  a gp91phox-containing NADPH oxidase is the critical link between Abeta and cerebrovascular dysfunction  which may underlie the alteration in cerebral blood flow regulation observed in AD patients.\",\n",

We used diffusion tensor tractography to investigate the FA of the cingulate fiber tracts in patients with PD with and without dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with PD  15 patients with PDD  and 15 age-matched healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging with a 3T MR imager. Diffusion tensor tractography images of the anterior and posterior cingulate fiber tracts were generated. Mean diffusivity and FA were measured along the tractography of the anterior and posterior cingulate fiber tracts. One-way ANOVA with the Scheffﾃｩ post hoc test was used to compare results among the groups. RESULTS: FA was significantly lower in patients with PDD than in healthy controls in both the anterior and the posterior cingulate fiber tracts (P = .003  P = .015) and significantly lower in patients with PD than in healthy controls (P = .003) in the anterior cingulate fiber tract. There were no significant mean diffusivity differences among the groups. MMSE and FA values of the anterior cingulate fiber tracts in patients with PDD were significantly correlated (r = 0.633  P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The reduced FA in patients with PD and PDD might reflect neuropathologic changes such as Lewy body pathology in the cingulate fibers.

To better understand the role of tau-mediated effects on pathophysiology and global central nervous system function  we extensively characterized gene expression  pathology and behavior of the rTg4510 mouse model  which overexpresses a mutant form of human tau that causes Frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). We found that the most predominantly altered gene expression pathways in rTg4510 mice were in inflammatory processes. These results closely matched the causal immune function and microglial gene-regulatory network recently identified in AD. We identified additional gene expression changes by laser microdissecting specific regions of the hippocampus  which highlighted alterations in neuronal network activity. Expression of inflammatory genes and markers of neuronal activity changed as a function of age in rTg4510 mice and coincided with behavioral deficits. Inflammatory changes were tau-dependent  as they were reversed by suppression of the tau transgene. Our results suggest that the alterations in microglial phenotypes that appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease may be driven by tau dysfunction  in addition to the direct effects of beta-amyloid.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'COVID-19 in critically ill patients in North Brabant, the Netherlands: Patient characteristics and outcomesPURPOSE: Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, countries are overwhelmed by critically ill Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. As ICU capacity becomes limited we characterized critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: In this case series, COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of the Jeroen Bosch Hospital were included from March 9 to April 7, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive result by a RT-PCR of a specimen collected by nasopharyngeal swab. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the 50 consecutively included critically ill COVID-19 patients was 65 +/- 10 years, the mean BMI was 29 +/- 4.7 and 66% were men. Seventy-eight percent of patients had >=1 comorbidity, 34% had hypertension. Ninety-six percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and 80% were ventilated in prone position. Venous thromboembolism was recognized in 36% of patients. Seventy-four percent of patients survived and were successfully discharged from the ICU, the remaining 26% died (median follow up 86 days). The length of invasive ventilation in survivors was 15 days (IQR 12-31). CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate of COVID-19 critically ill patients in our population is considerably better than previously reported. Thrombotic complications are commonly found and merit clinical attention. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NL2020.07.04.01. Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

       "  {'feature': 'Modelling the Number of Confirmed Cases and Deaths from COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK and Forecasting over April 15th - May 30th, 2020BACKGROUND: The UK is one of the epicenters of COVID-19 in the world. As of 14 April, there have been 93,873 confirmed patients of COVID-19 in the UK, and 12,107 deaths with confirmed infection. On 14 April, it was reported that COVID-19 was the cause of more than half of the deaths in London. METHODS: The present paper addresses the modeling and forecasting of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK. This modeling has be accomplished through a two-part time series model to study the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The period we aim at forecast is a 46-day from 15 April to 30 May, 2020. All the computations and simulations were conducted on Matlab R2015b, and the average curves and confidence intervals were calculated based on 100 simulations of the fitted models. RESULTS: According to the obtained model, we expect that the cumulative number of confirmed cases reaches 282000 with 80% confidence interval [242000 316500]) on 30th May, from 93873 on 14th April. In addition, it is expected that over this period, the number of daily new confirmed cases falls to the interval 1330 to 6450 with the probability of 0.80 by the point estimation around 3100. Regarding death, our model establishes that the real case fatality rate of the pandemic in the UK approaches 11% (80% confidence interval; 8% - 15%). Accordingly, we forecast that the total death in the UK rises to 35000 (28000-50000 with the probability of 80%). CONCLUSIONS: The drawback of this study is the shortage of observations. Also, to conduct a more exact study it is possible to take the number of the tests into account as an explanatory variable besides time.',\n",

In 13 of the 15 patients the rectal wall was thicker (mean (SEM) 5.7 (0.4) mm; normal values: 2.8 (0.1) mm) near the rectal ulcer. In all these cases the muscularis propia layer exceeded the maximum normal diameter of 2 mm. In nine of the 15 patients the normal rectal wall echostructure, with five distinct layers, was disturbed and there was fading of the borders between the mucosa and the muscularis propria. Poor relaxation of the puborectalis muscle during straining was seen on ultrasound in 11 patients, as was intussusception of the rectal wall. The obvious enlargement of the muscularis propria points to a chronic mechanical load on the rectal wall. The ulcerative lesions are formed in this area of overloaded rectal wall. The direct visualisation of the puborectalis muscle during dynamic transrectal ultrasonography indicates that the fact that it does not relax is an important element in the pathogenesis of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.',\n",

This study aims to examine individuals' perception of health conditions and test availability as potential predictors of mental health-insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress-during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during 2-8 May 2020, six weeks after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued. We found adults' perception of health conditions had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress. Perceived test availability for COVID-19 also had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health. The results indicated that adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, and the worse degree deepened for unhealthy people. Perceived test availability negatively predicted anxiety and depression, especially for adults perceiving COVID-19 test unavailability. The significant predictions of perceived health condition and perceived COVID-19 test availability suggest a new direction for the literature to identify the psychiatric risk factors directly from health-related variables during a pandemic.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the p75 neurotrophin receptor modulates its association with the TrkA receptor.The generation of biologically active proteins by regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a highly conserved mechanism in cell signaling. Presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity is responsible for the intramembrane proteolysis of selected type I membrane proteins  including beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. A small fraction of intracellular domains derived from both APP and Notch translocates to and appears to function in the nucleus  suggesting a generic role for gamma-secretase cleavage in nuclear signaling. Here we show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) undergoes presenilin-dependent intramembrane proteolysis to yield the soluble p75-intracellular domain. The p75NTR is a multifunctional type I membrane protein that promotes neurotrophin-induced neuronal survival and differentiation by forming a heteromeric co-receptor complex with the Trk receptors. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of p75NTR occurs at a position located in the middle of the transmembrane (TM) domain  which is reminiscent of the amyloid beta-peptide 40 (Abeta40) cleavage of APP and is topologically distinct from the major TM cleavage site of Notch 1. Size exclusion chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that TrkA forms a molecular complex together with either full-length p75 or membrane-tethered C-terminal fragments. The p75-ICD was not recruited into the TrkA-containing high molecular weight complex  indicating that gamma-secretase-mediated removal of the p75 TM domain may perturb the interaction with TrkA. Independent of the possible nuclear function  our studies suggest that gamma-secretase-mediated p75NTR proteolysis plays a role in the formation/disassembly of the p75-TrkA receptor complex by regulating the availability of the p75 TM domain that is required for this interaction.',\n",

The principal aim of the current study was to assess relationships between regional cerebral metabolism and estrogen-based hormone therapies. Postmenopausal women (n=53) at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) were on estrogen-containing hormone therapy for at least one year prior to enrollment in a prospective  randomized clinical trial. Subjects underwent an FDG-PET scan  along with neuropsychological  medical  and demographic assessments at time of enrollment  to be repeated one year following randomization to hormone therapy continuation versus discontinuation  and results from analyses of the baseline assessments are reported here.

METHODS: Evoked potentials and reaction times were collected from 12 healthy elderly controls and 10 patients with mild AD. Subjects pressed a response button to high-pitched target tones (P=0.20) that were randomly intermixed with low-pitched frequent tones. We measured pre-stimulus readiness potential (RP)  event-related potentials (P50  N100  P200  N200 and P300)  and reaction time as a function of the stimulus sequence. RESULTS: AD subjects performed at comparable levels of accuracy as controls  but had significantly increased reaction times. Grand averaged potentials in AD showed a significant reduction of the amplitude of the RP  and an increase of P300 latency. Both controls and AD showed speeding of reaction time  increases in RP amplitude  and decreases in P300 latency as a function of the number of frequents preceding the target. Sequential changes of other components (P200 and N200) were found in controls but not AD. CONCLUSIONS: AD patients have systematic changes of both RT and certain of the evoked potential components as a function of stimulus sequence. Moment-by-moment changes in target expectancy are largely preserved in AD  even though overall performance and evoked potential measures of expectancy (RP) and stimulus classification (P300 latency) are abnormal.\",\n",

Using positron emission tomography (PET)  we previously reported that wandering behavior in dementia was associated with a disturbed dopaminergic neuron system. We herein investigated the relationship between the severity of BPSD and the striatal D2 receptor density in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Ten patients with probable AD as per the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the AD and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) criteria and five normal subjects were examined with PET. The tracer used was [11C]raclopride (D2 antagonist). The uptake of [11C] raclopride was calculated as the estimation of binding potential (BP) of the striatum to the cerebellum. The AD patients were institutionalized in multiple nursing homes  and their BPSD were evaluated by the Behavioral Pathology in AD Frequency Weighted Severity Scale (BEHAVE-AD-FW) scale (Reisberg). RESULTS: There was a significant inverse Spearman's correlation between BEHAVE-AD-FW score and the BP  especially between the score of the behavioral domain and the BP values. The BP was found to be lower in severer BPSD patients.

In the present study  we tested the hypothesis that electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha rhythms  which are affected (i.e. decreased in amplitude) by AD processes  are relatively preserved in MCI subjects in whom the cognitive decline is mainly explained by white-matter vascular load. Resting EEG was recorded in 40 healthy elderly (Nold)  80 MCI  and 40 AD subjects. In the MCI subjects  white-matter vascular load was quantified based on MRI (0-30 Wahlund visual rating scale). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4Hz)  theta (4-8Hz)  alpha 1 (8-10.5Hz)  alpha 2 (10.5-13Hz)  beta 1 (13-20Hz)  and beta 2 (20-30Hz). Low resolution electromagnetic source tomography (LORETA) was used for EEG source analysis. As expected  we observed that alpha 1 sources in parietal  occipital  and temporal areas were lower in amplitude in the AD and MCI subjects than in the Nold subjects  whereas the amplitude of wide delta sources was higher in the AD than in the Nold and MCI subjects. As novel results  the amplitude of parietal  occipital  and temporal alpha 1 sources was higher in the MCI V+ (high vascular load; N=42; MMSE=26) than MCI V- group (low vascular load; N=37; MMSE=26.7).

Despite the importance of this clinical problem  our understanding of the underlying processes is poor and there is no effective treatment. This is a reflection of the poor homology between rodent models  the mainstay of research into kidney injury  and that which occurs in humans  and it has been suggested that large animal models of AKI with closer homology to humans are required if clinical progress is to be achieved. The aim of this programme of research was: To undertake a systematic review of the evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials that have evaluated pharmacological agents for the prevention of AKI post cardiac surgery. To characterise post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) AKI in a novel porcine recovery model with potentially greater homology to cardiac surgery patients. To determine the effect of endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor blockade on post CPB AKI in swine. To determine the effect of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibition on post CPB AKI in swine. Methods Systematic review We searched PubMed  Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials comparing renoprotective pharmacological interventions with control in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. We extracted data for mortality  need for renal replacement therapy (RRT)  incidence of AKI  and creatinine clearance at 24-48 hours. The meta-analysis was performed in line with recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration and the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses guidelines with standard software. Porcine recovery model of post-CPB AKI Plan of investigation Pigs (n=8 per group) were randomised to the following groups: Group 1. Sham operation. Pigs underwent a neck dissection under general anaesthesia. Group 2. CPB only. Pigs underwent 2.5 hours of CPB. Group 3. CPB plus sitaxsentan sodium (ET-A antagonist). Pigs underwent 2.5 hours of CPB. Each pig received an infusion of sitaxsentan sodium 0.7 mg/kg over 30 minutes  at commencement of CPB. Group 4. CPB plus sildenafil citrate (PDE-5 inhibitor). Pigs underwent 2.5 hours of CPB. Each pig received an infusion of sildenafil 10 mg over 30 minutes  at commencement of CPB. Experimental methods Thirty-two adult female Large White Landrace crossbred pigs weighing 50-70 kg were used. Minimally invasive CPB was achieved via Smart Cannulae<sup></sup> (Smartcanula LLC  Lausanne  Switzerland) placed in the aorta and right atrium via the right internal carotid artery and external jugular vein respectively. Heparinisation  priming  temperature  perfusion pressure  pump flows and acid base balance were managed according to standard protocols. Total CPB time was 2.5 hours. Sham procedure animals underwent similar general anaesthesia  surgical dissection and heparinisation as CPB operated animals. Urine output was measured via a urethral catheter. Animals were recovered  re-anaesthetised and re-evaluated at 24 hours. Collection of serum and urine samples and measurement of renal and endothelial function  oxygenation  and perfusion occured at four time points: Baseline  the end of CPB  1.5 hours post CPB and 24 hours post CPB. Organ harvest was performed prior to euthanasia. Outcomes Renal function: Creatinine clearance (primary outcome)  free water clearance and fractional sodium excretion were calculated from urine volumes and serum samples taken at the four specified time points using standard formulae. Renal injury: H&E stained 5 mum formalin fixed  paraffin embedded sections were scored for tubular injury by a renal histopathologist blinded to treatment allocation. Urinary IL-18  albumin and protein were measured in the urine. Renal endothelial function: Renal blood flow was recorded using a Transonic flow probe placed on the renal artery via a mini-laparotomy. Endothelial dysfunction was determined by the change in renal blood flow in respo se to a supra-renal aortic infusion of acetylcholine (0.1-10 mug/kg/min). Cortical perfusion and medullary oxygenation was measured by cortical surface probes and O<sub>2</sub> sensors connected to a dual channel tissue monitoring system (Oxylite  Oxford Optronix  Oxford UK). Mechanisms: Endothelial injury-immunocytochemistry (ICC) for lectin Dolichos biflorus agglutinin  Pecam-1 and ve-Cadherin.

High energy phosphates-will be measured using HPLC of snap frozen tissue  Apoptosis-assessed using In-Situ End Labelling (ISEL). Results Systematic review Forty-nine randomised controlled trials involving 4 605 patients were included. Pharmacological interventions included dopamine  fenoldopam  (Table Presented) calcium channel antagonists  natriuretic peptides  diuretics  and N-acetylcysteine. Most trials were of poor quality  with small sample sizes  under reporting of randomisation procedure  allocation concealment and method of blinding. No pharmacological intervention significantly reduced mortality or the reported incidence of AKI. Fenoldopam and atrial natriuretic peptide reduced the need for renal replacement therapy by 70% (NNT 21  95% CI 113  830) and 76% (NNT 29  95% CI 171  844) respectively. Dopamine caused a significant reduction in creatinine clearance (-426 mL/min  95% CI-714 -139). Post-cardiopulmonary bypass acute kidney injury in swine CPB caused AKI characterised by a mean reduction in creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.1 to 94.0) and a mean rise in IL-18 of 211.5 pg/ml (95% CI 107.4 to 315.6) compared to sham procedures (Table 1). This was associated with vascular endothelial injury  activation and dysfunction  reduced NO bioavailability and a significant increase in the expression of the paracrine vasoconstrictors adenosine and endothelin-1 (Figure 1). In post CPB kidneys at 24 hours there was persistent hypoxia at the level of the outer medulla  cortical ATP depletion and evidence of proximal tubule epithelial cell stress and apoptosis. There was no evidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CPB caused changes in the podocyte slit diaphragm and marked proteinuria. Effect of ET-A receptor antagonism using sitaxsentan sodium When compared to CPB  sitaxsentan prevented AKI by preserving creatinine clearance  reducing proteinuria and IL-18 excretion  and preserving intra-renal high energy phosphates (Table 1).

Neurological impairment and disability were quantified by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Neuroimaging included spine and brain MRI and brain SPECT by radiolabeling technetium (Tc99m) Ethyl Cisteynate Dimer (ECD). Disease progression halted after treatment in both patients.

Methods: Thirty COVID-19 (eight mild type and twenty-two common type) patients were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and a semi-structured interview. Results: All 30 patients reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The levels of depression and anxiety in mild type COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than those in common type COVID-19 patients. Significant improvements in depression (P<0.001) and anxiety (P<0.001) levels were found in the COVID-19 patients at the second evaluation compared with the baseline (admittance to hospital). More than 80% patients agreed that medical security, support from other patients, and a better living environment were the main reasons for improvements to their adverse psychological states. Conclusions: Varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and insomnia frequently occur in patients with COVID-19.

Only drugs that are already registered or close to registration, and therefore have passed lengthy safety assessments, have a chance to be tested in clinical trials and reach patients quickly enough to help in the current disease outbreak. Here, we have reviewed available evidence and possible ways forward to identify already existing pharmaceuticals displaying modest broad-spectrum antiviral activity which is likely linked to their high accumulation in cells. Several well studied examples indicate that these drugs accumulate in lysosomes, endosomes and biological membranes in general, and thereby interfere with endosomal pathway and intracellular membrane trafficking crucial for viral infection. With the aim to identify other lysosomotropic drugs with possible inherent antiviral activity, we have applied a set of clear physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and molecular criteria on 530 existing drugs. In addition to publicly available data, we have also used our in silico model for the prediction of accumulation in lysosomes and endosomes. By this approach we have identified 36 compounds with possible antiviral effects, also against coronaviruses. For 14 of them evidence of broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported, adding support to the value of this approach. Presented pros and cons, knowledge gaps and methods to identify lysosomotropic antivirals, can help in the evaluation of many drugs currently in clinical trials considered for repurposing to target COVID-19, as well as open doors to finding more potent and safer alternatives.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s)',\n",

Inflammation may be an underlying mechanism for CMB  with varying associations according to CMB location. Lipoprotein phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA2) is a circulating enzyme marker of vascular inflammation associated with risk of ischemic stroke and dementia. We hypothesized that higher Lp-PLA2 levels would be related to higher prevalence of CMB  with possible regional specificity. METHODS: Framingham Offspring participants aged 65 years or older with available Lp-PLA2 measures and brain magnetic resonance imaging were included. Logistic regression models were used to relate Lp-PLA2 activity and mass to presence of CMB  adjusted for age  sex  medication use (aspirin  anticoagulants  and statins)  systolic blood pressure  APOE  current smoking  and diabetes. RESULTS: Eight-hundred nineteen participants (mean age  73 years; 53% women) were included; 106 (13%) had CMB  82 (10%) were lobar  and 27 (3%) were deep. We did not observe significant associations of CMB and LpPLA2 measures in multivariable adjusted analyses. However  there was a significant interaction between APOE genotype and Lp-PLA2 activity in their relation to presence of deep CMB (P interaction=0.01). Among persons with APOE ﾎｵ3/ﾎｵ3  the odds ratio for deep CMB was 0.95 (confidence interval  0.59-1.53; P=0.83)  whereas among those with at least 1 ﾎｵ2 or ﾎｵ4 allele  odds ratio was 3.46 (confidence interval  1.43-8.36; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In our community-based sample of older adults  there was no significant association of Lp-PLA2 with total or lobar CMB. The association of higher levels of Lp-PLA2 activity with deep CMB among those with at least 1 APOE ﾎｵ2 or ﾎｵ4 allele merits replication.',\n",

We completed a combined examination of all three branches of adaptive immunity at the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in acute and convalescent subjects. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were each associated with milder disease. Coordinated SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune responses were associated with milder disease, suggesting roles for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in protective immunity in COVID-19. Notably, coordination of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific responses was disrupted in individuals >= 65 years old. Scarcity of naive T cells was also associated with aging and poor disease outcomes. A parsimonious explanation is that coordinated CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and antibody responses are protective, but uncoordinated responses frequently fail to control disease, with a connection between aging and impaired adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.

Subcortical gray matter structures have also been implicated in dementia resulting from vascular pathology  particularly vascular dementia. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of changes in subcortical gray matter structures to post-stroke dementia (PSD). METHODS: T1- and T2-weighted images and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were obtained on a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) system  in four groups aged over 75 years: post-stroke with dementia (PSD; 8)  post-stroke no dementia (PSnoD; 33)  Alzheimer's disease (AD; 26) and controls (30). Automated software was used to measure the volume of thalamus  putamen  caudate nucleus  and hippocampus as well as total WMH volume. The number of subcortical lacunes was also counted. RESULTS: The number of caudate lacunes was higher in the PSnoD group  compared with AD (p = 0.029) and controls (p = 0.019). The putamen volume was smaller in the stroke and AD groups  when compared with controls. In the whole stroke group  putamen lacunes were correlated with impairment in memory (Rey test; ﾏ = -0.365; p = 0.031)  while WMH and hippocampal volume both correlated with global dysfunction.

In addition to dysregulated production  increasing experimental evidence suggests reduced catabolism plays an important role in Abeta accumulation. Although endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) degrade and thus contribute to regulating the steady-state levels of Abeta  how these enzymes are regulated remain poorly understood.

Treatment with HNE or Abeta upregulated ECE-1 mRNA and protein  while IDE was unchanged. Although both ECE-1 and IDE were oxidized within 24 h of HNE or Abeta treatment  ECE-1 catalytic activity was elevated while IDE specific activity was unchanged. The results demonstrated for the first time that both ECE-1 and IDE are substrates of HNE modification induced by Abeta.

It is necessary to explore the aftereffects of COVID-19 in patients and compare the laboratory features of COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias in the recovery stages. METHODS: Forty-seven cases of COVID-19 and 45 cases of other viral pneumonias (control) were included in this study. The laboratory parameters were compared between COVID-19 and control patients as well as severe and moderate COVID-19 patients from the clinical recovery stage to the 4 weeks postdischarge recovery stage. RESULTS: A higher RDW-CV level and neutrophil percentage and lower levels of total proteins, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and MCH were found in COVID-19 patients compared with those in controls from the clinical recovery to the postdischarge recovery stages. Further analysis showed that decreases in lymphocytes, total proteins, and SOD and elevations in neutrophils, FDP, CRP, and ESR were more common in severe than moderate cases of COVID-19 during hospitalization; however, differences in these indicators, except total proteins, were not observed in the postdischarge recovery stages. Additionally, only 76.9% of COVID-19 patients were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the convalescence stage, and one patient that was negative for specific IgG was reinfected. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that patients recovering from COVID-19 might need better care than that patients with other viral pneumonias due to the possibility of having poor immunity and nutritional conditions.

While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human norovirus surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r2 = 0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D90 - dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21.5 and 28 J/m2, respectively (with an estimated 18 J/m2 obtained from published experimental data for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D90 of 21 J/m2 close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D90 values of 69.1, 89, and 77.6 J/m2 for genogroups GI, GII, and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D90 = 100 J/m2 was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential non-pathogenic (to humans) surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Pendyala, Patras, Pokharel and D'Souza.\",\n",

METHODS: (18)F-FDG PET was performed at baseline  1-7 d  and 4 or 8 wk after imatinib mesylate initiation. Best objective response was defined by version 1.0 of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

As no approved therapeutics exists to treat COVID-19, the disease associated to SARS-Cov-2, there is an urgent need to propose molecules that could quickly enter into clinics. Repurposing of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time-consuming stages of drug development. In this study, we screened the PRESTWICK CHEMICAL LIBRARY composed of 1,520 approved drugs in an infected cell-based assay. The robustness of the screen was assessed by the identification of drugs that already demonstrated in vitro antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Thereby, 90 compounds were identified as positive hits from the screen and were grouped according to their chemical composition and their known therapeutic effect. Then EC50 and CC50 were determined for a subset of 15 compounds from a panel of 23 selected drugs covering the different groups. Eleven compounds such as macrolides antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, antiarrhythmic agents or CNS drugs emerged showing antiviral potency with 2 < EC50 <= 20 micro M. By providing new information on molecules inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, this study provides information for the selection of drugs to be further validated in vivo. Disclaimer: This study corresponds to the early stages of antiviral development and the results do not support by themselves the use of the selected drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

This  together with findings showing that IL-1 activates MAPK-p38 in vitro and is markedly overexpressed in Alzheimer brain  suggest a role for IL-1-induced MAPK-p38 activation in the genesis of neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease. We found frequent colocalization of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (AT8 antibody) and activated MAPK-p38 in neurons and in dystrophic neurites in Alzheimer brain  and frequent association of these structures with activated microglia overexpressing IL-1. Tissue levels of IL-1 mRNA as well as of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated isoforms of tau were elevated in these brains. Significant correlations were found between the numbers of AT8- and MAPK-p38-immunoreactive neurons  and between the numbers of activated microglia overexpressing IL-1 and the numbers of both AT8- and MAPK-p38-immunoreactive neurons. Furthermore  rats bearing IL-1-impregnated pellets showed a six- to seven-fold increase in the levels of MAPK-p38 mRNA  compared with rats with vehicle-only pellets (P<0.0001).

In spite of a significant mortality rate, in the majority of cases the spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic infection. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during pandemic. Method(s): From April 1st, 2020 to the end of the month, 560 consecutive and unselected patients, scheduled for anticancer treatment at our facility and without clinical suspicious of COVID-19, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including a rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM and a pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay in case of IgM seropositivity. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of type of cancer, stage and treatment. All IgM-seropositives were then tested with RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs and 55/146 (38%) proved to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers, with slightly difference b/w mildly symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients (38 vs. 17). Therefore, the two-step procedure allowed the identification of 55 (10%) silent carriers in the whole study population and magnified the number needed to test (NNT) with the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay to detect a silent virus carrier (NNT: 2.6 vs. 10, with or without serological selection). At a very early follow up (8 wks), in 114 SARS-CoV-2-seropostive/RT-PCR-negative patients, who continued their anticancer therapies, none but one developed a symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among cancer patients, the two-step diagnostics strategy with serology followed by pharyngeal swab for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible and effective and can help selecting cancer patients on treatment who might be silent carriers of the virus. The early safety outcome of patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 supports the recommendation to continue active treatment, at least in the case of negative RT-PCR test.

Adherence to social isolation policies (social distancing, sheltering in place, and cessation of long-distance travel), use of nonsocial precautionary measures (handwashing, wearing a mask), core belief violation, meaning made of the COVID pandemic, and CA were assessed in a sample of 408 North Americans. Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA. These results suggest that social isolation policies support the integrity of adherents' meaning systems, thereby mitigating distress, which carries useful implications for both policy and psychological intervention.\",\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 20 patients affected by PTC with evidence of neck nodes recurrences at ultrasound examination. Our method has been derived from the Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization technique used for pre-operative localization of occult breast lesions. The technique involves the inoculation of human albumin macroaggregates labeled with radioactive technetium (0.4 mCi in a volume of 0.05 ml) directly in the suspicious lesion  under ultrasound guidance. The persistence of the radioactive tracer in the nodes is confirmed by a scintigraphy performed 2 h after injection. During surgery  a gamma detecting probe is used to locate the suspicious lesions as \"hot spots\". RESULTS: Fifty lymph-nodes were injected with the tracer. All radiolabeled lymph-nodes were located and removed during surgery. At histology  metastasis of PTC was confirmed in 38/50 (76%) lymph-nodes. At least one metastatic lymph-node per patient was removed. In 8/20 (40%) patients  reactive lymphoid hyperplasia was found in 12/50 (24%) lymph-nodes. CONCLUSIONS: This radioguided technique has been highly effective for localization and surgical treatment of suspicious lymph-node detected at neck ultrasound and may play a valuable role in case of node metastases of thyroid cancer that show no radioiodine uptake.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'HDDD2 is a familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions caused by a missense mutation in the signal peptide of progranulin.OBJECTIVE: Familial autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia with ubiquitin-positive  tau-negative inclusions in the brain linked to 17q21-22 recently has been reported to carry null mutations in the progranulin gene (PGRN). Hereditary dysphasic disinhibition dementia (HDDD) is a frontotemporal dementia with prominent changes in behavior and language deficits. A previous study found significant linkage to chromosome 17 in a HDDD family (HDDD2)  but no mutation in the MAPT gene. Longitudinal follow-up has enabled us to identify new cases and to further characterize the dementia in this family. The goals of this study were to develop research criteria to classify the different clinical expressions of dementia observed in this large kindred  to identify the causal mutation in affected individuals and correlate this with phenotypic characteristics in this pedigree  and to assess the neuropathological characteristics using immunohistochemical techniques. METHODS: In this study we describe a detailed clinical  pathological and mutation analysis of the HDDD2 kindred. RESULTS: Neuropathologically  HDDD2 represents a familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive  tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U). We developed research classification criteria and identified three distinct diagnostic thresholds  which helped localize the disease locus. The chromosomal region with the strongest evidence of linkage lies within the minimum critical region for FTLD-U. Sequencing of each exon of the PGRN gene led to the identification of a novel missense mutation  Ala-9 Asp  within the signal peptide. INTERPRETATION: HDDD2 is an FTLD-U caused by a missense mutation in the PGRN gene that cosegregates with the disease and with the disease haplotype in at-risk individuals. This mutation is the first reported pathogenic missense mutation in the signal peptide of the PGRN gene causing FTLD-U. In light of the previous reports of null mutations and its position in the gene  two possible pathological mechanisms are proposed: (1) the protein may accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum due to inefficient secretion; and (2) mutant RNA may have a lower expression because of degradation via nonsense-mediated decay.',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"Diagnostic serial interval as a novel indicator for contact tracing effectiveness exemplified with the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreak in South KoreaBACKGROUND: The clinical onset serial interval is often used as a proxy for the transmission serial interval of an infectious disease. For SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, data on clinical onset serial intervals is limited, since symptom onset dates are not routinely recorded and do not exist in asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: We define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. Based on the DS4C project data on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea, we estimate the means of the diagnostic serial interval, the clinical onset serial interval and the difference between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. RESULTS: The mean of the diagnostic serial interval was estimated to be 3.63 days (95% CI: 3.24, 4.01). The diagnostic serial interval was shown to be significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean difference -1.12 days, 95% CI: -1.98, -0.26). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively short diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea are likely due to the country's extensive efforts towards contact tracing. We suggest the mean diagnostic serial interval as a new indicator for the effectiveness of a country's contact tracing as part of the epidemic surveillance. Copyright Â© 2020.

While fast isolation of suspected cases plays an essential role to avoid disease outbreaks, significant rates of asymptomatic cases have recently been described. After detecting an outbreak in one of our HD clinics, wide SARS-CoV-2 screening and segregation of confirmed cases were performed. Methods: The entire clinic population, 192 patients, underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to define variables involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in our dialysis unit. Later, we analysed differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Results: In total, 22 symptomatic and 14 of the 170 asymptomatic patients had a SARS-CoV-2-positive result. Living in a nursing home/homeless [odds ratio (OR) 3.54; P = 0.026], having been admitted to the reference hospital within the previous 2 weeks (OR 5.19; P = 0.002) and sharing health-care transportation with future symptomatic (OR 3.33; P = 0.013) and asymptomatic (OR 4.73; P = 0.002) positive patients were independent risk factors for a positive test. Nine positive patients (25.7%) remained asymptomatic after a 3-week follow-up. We found no significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Conclusions: Detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is probably one of the key points to controlling an outbreak in an HD unit. Sharing health-care transportation to the dialysis unit, living in a nursing home and having been admitted to the reference hospital within the previous 2 weeks, are major risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The chemotherapy significantly reduced the volume of the tumor in 6 of 7 patients and the highest CMRglc in the tumor examined 18.0 +/- 5.5 days after the chemotherapy (34.0 +/- 21.8 micromol/100 g/min) was significantly lower than that observed before the chemotherapy (p < 0.01). This reduction in FDG uptake was concomitant with a significant reduction in both the K1 and k3 values (p < 0.05). The reduction in the k3 value after the chemotherapy was marked in 6 of 7 patients in whom the tumor responded to the first chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic image acquisition can separate regional FDG uptake into FDG transport and phosphorylation activity in the lymphoma tissues. Tumor FDG uptake was significantly higher with accelerated phosphorylation activity compared with that observed in the normal cortex',\n",

It is unknown whether hemodialysis patients represent a distinct group of patients with certain characteristics that may make them susceptible to infection or severe disease. In this Case Report, we describe the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 in 201 maintenance hemodialysis patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan university, including 5 maintenance hemodialysis patients who contracted COVID-19 disease. Of the 5 patients with COVID-19, one had a definite history of contact with an infected person. The age range of the patients was 47-67 years. Diarrhea (80%), fever (60%), and fatigue (60%) were the most common symptoms. Lymphopenia occurred in all patients.Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans showed ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients.

       "  {'feature': \"Semantic memory deficits in low-educated patients with Alzheimer's disease.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although a deficit of semantic memory is evident in the dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT)  the underlying neuropsychologic mechanism remains controversial. Breakdown of the semantic network during the course of DAT and an inability to access semantic information have been postulated as possible explanations  but supporting data are limited  particularly in low-educated patients. This study examined semantic memory in low-educated patients with different degrees of dementia severity. METHODS: In total  197 adult subjects were recruited  including 165 DAT patients and 32 normal controls. Subjects were divided into four subgroups according to their dementia severity. All subjects completed an episodic memory task  the Six-Object Memory Test  and semantic memory tasks including the Object Naming Test  the Remote Memory Test and the Semantic Association of Verbal Fluency Test. One-way ANOVA and ANCOVA with a post hoc Scheffe's procedure were used to evaluate differences between groups. RESULTS: All patients  irrespective of the degree of dementia  showed impaired performance on the Six-Object Memory Test [F (4  163) = 69.95  p < 0.0001 for immediate recall; F (4  163) = 41.34  p < 0.0001 for delayed recall]. On the semantic memory tasks  patients with moderate to severe dementia showed impaired performances on the Object Naming Test [F (4  180) = 28.25  p < 0.0001] and the Remote Memory Test [F (4  167) = 26.22  p < 0.0001 for recall; F (4  167) = 34.80  p < 0.0001 for recognition]  while all patients performed defectively on the Semantic Association of Verbal Fluency Test [F (4  194) = 70.43  p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSION: Our results thus partially support the hypotheses that a loss of semantic structure and an inability to access semantic knowledge occur in the pathogenesis of DAT.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': \"COVID-19 and STEMIThe COVID-19 pandemic had an unexpected impact on cardiovascular emergencies, particularly STEMI. The France PCI registry and other studies around the world have highlighted a significant decrease in myocardial infarctions arriving at hospital. This decrease is mainly related to patients' fear of coming to the hospital and being contaminated. Although the STEMI revascularisation time targets (<120min) are often difficult to achieve in normal times, they were almost impossible to achieve in periods of lockdown because of the many obstacles. Longer delays and longer total ischemic time have led to excess mortality, especially in the regions most affected by the epidemic. Recommendations for the management of STEMI during the COVID-19 period have thus been issued by the scientific societies. STEMI in patients with COVID-19 often have an uncommon clinical presentation, and the absence of coronary obstruction on angiography is frequent. Their prognosis is very poor. Only public information campaigns and an organisation adapted to the management of coronary emergencies during epidemics can try to limit their effects and avoid aggravating an already fragile health situation in the future.

       "  {'feature': 'Contrasting gray and white matter changes in preclinical Huntington disease: an MRI study.BACKGROUND: In Huntington disease (HD)  substantial striatal atrophy precedes clinical motor symptoms. Accordingly  neuroprotection should prevent major cell loss before such symptoms arise. To evaluate neuroprotection  biomarkers such as MRI measures are needed. This requires first establishing the best imaging approach. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design  we acquired T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted scans in 39 preclinical (pre-HD) individuals and 25 age-matched controls. T1-weighted scans were analyzed with gross whole-brain segmentation and voxel-based morphometry. Analysis of diffusion-weighted scans used skeleton-based tractography. For all imaging measures  we compared pre-HD and control groups and within the pre-HD group we examined correlations with estimated years to clinical onset. RESULTS: Pre-HD individuals had lower gross gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume. Voxel-wise analysis demonstrated local GM volume loss  most notably in regions consistent with basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways. By contrast  pre-HD individuals showed widespread reductions in WM integrity  probably due to a loss of axonal barriers. Both GM and WM imaging measures correlated with estimated years to onset. CONCLUSIONS: Using automated  observer-independent methods  we found that GM loss in pre-HD was regionally specific  while WM deterioration was much more general and probably the result of demyelination rather then axonal degeneration. These findings provide important information about the nature  relative staging  and topographic specificity of brain changes in pre-HD and suggest that combining GM and WM imaging may be the best biomarker approach. The empirically derived group difference images from this study are provided as regions-of-interest masks for improved sensitivity in future longitudinal studies.',\n",

The transport of a water soluble molecule across the brain and tumor capillary endothelium was studied during glucocorticoid and radiation treatment. The brain and brain-tumor acidity (pH) was evaluated as a single measurement in patients receiving a low maintenance dose of glucocorticoid. Transport changes and pH were measured in 61 patients with cerebral tumors using 82Rubidium (82Rb) and 11C-Dimethyloxa-zolidindione (11C-DMO)  respectively  and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Supplementary studies of tumor and contralateral brain blood flow and blood volume using the C15O2/PET and C15O/PET technique  respectively  were included to validate the 82Rb/PET model and obtain further information. A total of 125 PET scans were performed. Supplementary studies were undertaken to estimate delay of blood registration and form distribution of arterial blood isotope activity curves. Blood-to-tumor barrier transport was outlined at baseline and at 6 and 24 hours after the start of glucocorticoid treatment  finding a significant decrease in the transport. Radiation treatment (2-6 gray) did not alter the blood-to-tumor barrier transport when restudied within one hour in patients receiving glucocorticoid. In accordance with others  we observed pH values in gray and white matter in the range of 6.74-7.09 and 6.77-7.03 respectively. The pH in brain tumors was as high as 6.88-7.26  suggesting that tumors are more alkalotic than the normal brain. The permeability surface area product and the permeability coefficient were determined from the 82Rb/PET transport and C15O2/PET flow studies. Baseline permeability values were comparable to the literature values both for 82Rb and potassium. No difference in tissue blood volume was seen between 82Rb/PET and C15O/PET models and was of the same magnitude in the tumor and the contralateral tissue. The pH and fluid control in human brain tumors are perceived as metabolically controlled rather than  as previously believed  a result of simple passive exchange of alkalotic or osmotic active molecules between plasma and tumor interstitial space. Aspects of tumor alkalosis  tumor edema production  glucocorticoid edema clearance  and relationship between the anti-edema effect of glucocorticoid and the shown transport changes to 82Rb will be reviewed in the light of metabolic control mechanisms',\n",

Longitudinal mixed effects models with a change point were used to model the aging process in those with and without an MCI diagnosis during follow-up and to model the rate of change relative to the age of onset of MCI. MCI had a preclinical stage of accelerated cognitive loss that was observed 3 to 4 years before the diagnosis of MCI on tests of verbal memory  animal fluency  and visuospatial constructions. Evidence from memory performance before the change point suggests that a slow decline in memory precedes the period of accelerated decline in the development of MCI.

Previous structural and functional studies on TDP-43 have been mostly focused on its recognized domains. Very recently  however  its extreme N terminus was identified to be a double-edged sword indispensable for both physiology and proteinopathy  but thus far its structure remains unknown due to the severe aggregation. Here as facilitated by our previous discovery that protein aggregation can be significantly minimized by reducing salt concentrations  by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy we revealed that the TDP-43 N terminus encodes a well-folded structure in concentration-dependent equilibrium with its unfolded form. Despite previous failure in detecting any sequence homology to ubiquitin  the folded state was determined to adopt a novel ubiquitin-like fold by the CS-Rosetta program with NMR chemical shifts and 78 unambiguous long-range nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) constraints. Remarkably  this ubiquitin-like fold could bind ssDNA  and the binding shifted the conformational equilibrium toward reducing the unfolded population. To the best of our knowledge  the TDP-43 N terminus represents the first ubiquitin-like fold capable of directly binding nucleic acid. Our results provide a molecular mechanism rationalizing the functional dichotomy of TDP-43 and might also shed light on the formation and dynamics of cellular ribonucleoprotein granules  which have been recently linked to ALS pathogenesis. As a consequence  one therapeutic strategy for TDP-43-causing diseases might be to stabilize its ubiquitin-like fold by ssDNA or designed molecules.',\n",

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiologic effects of the coronary sequelae of Kawasaki disease on coronary hemodynamic variables have not been completely clarified  and we previously reported some discrepancies between coronary angiographic findings and exercise stress tests in Kawasaki disease. METHODS: Doppler phasic coronary flow velocity was determined using an 0.018-in. (0.046-cm) intracoronary Doppler flow guide wire at rest and during the adenosine triphosphate-induced hyperemic response in 95 patients (75 male  20 female  mean age 9.8+/-6.2 years) with Kawasaki disease. RESULTS: In 25 patients with coronary aneurysms in 29 vessels  the average peak velocity and diastolic to systolic velocity ratio were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the moderate-sized and large-sized aneurysms. Significantly lower values in coronary flow reserve (CFR) were noted in 3 of 10 vessels with moderate aneurysms and in 4 of 7 vessels with large aneurysms. A significant positive correlation (y = 0.53x + 14.6  r2 = 0.91) was observed between the percent diameter stenosis evaluated by angiography and that calculated from the flow velocity measurement. However  the percent diameter stenosis calculated from the flow velocity measurement was underestimated compared with that determined by angiography in the stenotic lesions of intermediate severity. A reduced CFR was noted in five of seven vessels with intermediate stenosis ranging from 50% to 75%  and also in three vessels with mild stenosis ranging from 30% to 40%. A reduced CFR was also observed in six of the eight angiographically normal vessels associated with the area of reduced perfusion on exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in flow dynamics and a reduction in flow reserve were revealed in coronary aneurysms of intermediate to large size and in stenotic lesions  even of mild to intermediate severity  in patients with Kawasaki disease. Abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation  as well as epicardial lesions  contribute to the pathophysiologic responses in Kawasaki disease.',\n",

We have now adapted these methods to enrich the Abeta fraction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. Human CSF and plasma and Tg2576 mouse plasma were subjected to guanidine denaturation followed by SPE in 96-well cassettes. The resulting eluates could be concentrated significantly to enhance detection of low-abundance Abeta peptides by immunoassay. The concentrated eluates diluted in a linear fashion with consistent recovery between SPE columns. This technique was therefore used to facilitate quantification of Abeta1-X  1-40  1-42  and 1-38 peptides in normal human CSF and plasma samples. SPE sample preparation was also applied to the plasma of mice dosed peripherally with a monoclonal antibody raised against Abeta. When such samples were assayed directly  the presence of the systemically administered antibody interfered with the subsequent immunoassay  by preventing detection of antibody-bound Abeta. After subjecting plasma from antibody-treated animals to denaturation and SPE  the antibody-antigen complex was disrupted  and the Abeta fraction could be isolated from the antibody-containing fraction. Application of this method allowed for detection of a 100-fold increase in plasma Abeta1-40 following treatment of Tg2576 mice or wild type littermate control mice with Abeta40-specific monoclonal antibody 9TL. Given the availability of a variety of SPE matrices  we hypothesize that these methods could facilitate plasma antigen retrieval using multiple therapeutic antibody approaches.',\n",

The most obvious is dysarthria when motor movements are deprived of the regulatory control  which is one of the main functions of the cerebellum. Less well-known is cerebellar mutism  which most often occurs after the removal of a cerebellar tumour. It is unlikely that this is simply the result of dysarthria.

A number of studies have suggested that the cerebellum can  indeed  be involved in both cognition and language.

In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression analysis and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.

Existing findings have shown that AD is closely related to alteration in the functional brain network  i.e.  the functional connectivity between different brain regions. In this paper  we propose a method based on sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) to identify functional brain connectivity networks from PET data. Our method is able to identify both the connectivity network structure and strength for a large number of brain regions with small sample sizes. We apply the proposed method to the PET data of AD  mild cognitive impairment (MCI)  and normal control (NC) subjects. Compared with NC  AD shows decrease in the amount of inter-region functional connectivity within the temporal lobe especially between the area around hippocampus and other regions and increase in the amount of connectivity within the frontal lobe as well as between the parietal and occipital lobes. Also  AD shows weaker between-lobe connectivity than within-lobe connectivity and weaker between-hemisphere connectivity  compared with NC. In addition to being a method for knowledge discovery about AD  the proposed SICE method can also be used for classifying new subjects  which makes it a suitable approach for novel connectivity-based AD biomarker identification. Our experiments show that the best sensitivity and specificity our method can achieve in AD vs. NC classification are 88% and 88%  respectively.\",\n",

Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing. Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females. The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years). All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%). The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days. In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 x 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 x 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well. All Lymphocyte counts were normal. There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases. There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung. All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir. The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 +/- 6.54 days.

METHODS: Video-calls using Wechat software (Tencent, Shenzhen, China) between patients and vascular surgeons were conducted in a period when there were restrictions and limitations for people' travels in China. At the end of each video-call, a short questionnaire was used to evaluate the patient satisfaction level. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period from 19 February to 16 March 2020, a sample of 114 from 165 (69%) patients were reached after one phone call attempt. One hundred and forty-two telemedicine remote communications were made between the two vascular surgeons and 114 patients. The mean age of this cohort of patients were 60+/-15.2 (range 25 to 90) years old, and 74 (65%) were male. Twenty-five patients (22%) were outside of our province when they received the video-call. The mean duration of the video-call was 11.0+/-8.9 minutes. All of the patients thought telemedicine was a good substitute for coming to hospital, and 95% (108/114) of them preferred to have remote telemedicine rather than postpone the appointment. All the patients agreed with the advantages of telemedicine including no infection risks, no need to travel and no need to wait for long time. All the patients were 'satisfied' or 'highly satisfied' with the video-call and they would like to use telemedicine for follow-up in the future.

METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study, carried out in a referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We reviewed the clinical records of patients consecutively admitted for confirmed COVID-19 over a 1-month period (1-31 March 2020). We excluded asymptomatic discharged patients. We identified risk factors for death, by a uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. To improve model fitting and hazard estimation, continuous parameters where dichotomized by using Youden's index. RESULTS: Overall, 69 patients, aged 80-98 years, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study cohort. The median age was 84 years (82-89 years is interquartile range); 37 patients (53.6%) were men. Globally, 14 patients (20.3%) presented a mild, 30 (43.5%) a severe and 25 (36.2%) a critical COVID-19 disease. A total of 23 (33.3%) patients had died at 30 days' follow up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that severe dementia, pO2 <=90 at admission and lactate dehydrogenase >464 U/L were independent risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that risk of death could be not age dependent in patients aged >=80 years, whereas severe dementia emerged is a relevant risk factor in this population. Severe COVID-19, as expressed by elevated lactate dehydrogenase and low oxygen saturation at emergency department admission, is associated with a rapid progression to death in these patients.

       "  {'feature': \"Radiological imaging of inflammatory bowel diseaseThe term ﾂｫchronic inflammatory bowel diseaseﾂｻ represents a spectrum of diseases out of which ulcerous colitis and Crohn's disease are the far most common. Large bowel enemas have lost their relevance compared to colonoscopy over the past years and small bowel enteroclysis has also been widely replaced by CT- and especially MR-enteroclysis meanwhile. The diagnostic value of computed tomography and MR-tomography in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is based on the excellent visualization and documentation of extent and severity of bowel wall inflammation, estimation of inflammatory activity of the disease and of detection of potential extraintestinal complications and/or additional diagnoses by these two methods. Nevertheless, conventional radiological techniques as well as sonography may still be valuable under certain conditions. Furthermore, nowadays imaging of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases includes also White Blood Cell scintigraphy as well as Positrone Emission Tomography which provide informations about extent and especially activity of the disease. The presented article provides an overview of the possibilities and limitations of the available imaging modalities in inflammatory bowel diseases and helps the reader to decide under what conditions which one of the available examinations should be regarded as the most appropriate and promising one.\",\n",

METHODS We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), and death counts from 2018, and population on July 1st, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to 5 July 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences with respect to 2019. RESULTS Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23rd to April 5th), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020 also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.9 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.8 years among men in Madrid. CONCLUSIONS Life expectancy is an easy to interpret measure for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly and annual life expectancy are sensitive and useful indicators for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units.',\n",

Methods and Materials: Two hundred forty-five patients with 1 to 10 metastases who underwent SRS between January 2002 and December 2007 were included in the study. Of those  168 patients were treated with SRS alone and 77 patients received SRS followed by WBRT. Actuarial curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method regarding overall survival (OS)  distant brain control (DC)  and local brain control (LC) stratified by RPA class. Analyses for known prognostic variables were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that control of the primary tumor  small number of brain metastases  Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) > 70  and initial treatment modalities were significant predictors for survival. For RPA class 1  SRS plus WBRT was associated with a longer survival time compared with SRS alone (854 days vs. 426 days  p = 0.042). The SRS plus WBRT group also showed better LC rate than did the SRS-alone group (p = 0.021)  although they did not show a better DC rate (p = 0.079). By contrast  for RPA class 2 or 3  no significant difference in OS  LC  or DC was found between the two groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that RPA classification should determine whether or not WBRT is added to SRS. WBRT may be recommended to be added to SRS for patients in whom long-term survival is expected on the basis of RPA classification. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. Printed in the USA.

In addition  tracer metabolism may be different from normal brain. Mathematical arguments demonstrate that quantitation in inhomogeneous tissue is extremely difficult with tracers undergoing reversible metabolism  whereas irreversible metabolic steps can be quantified more easily. Even for metabolically inert tracers with reversible transport across the BBB  physiological identification of transport rate constants may be ambiguous  since diffusion processes within the tissue cannot be differentiated from slow transport components at the BBB. Mathematical analysis shows that transport is usually underestimated  whereas metabolism is usually overestimated in inhomogeneous tumor tissue. For accurate measurements of blood flow and BBB permeability  use of short measurement times is recommended. Measurements of tumor glucose consumption with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are probably only little affected by tumor heterogeneity. There are  however  major problems caused by variation of the lumped constant  which relates the kinetics of FDG to those of glucose. Most experimental data indicate a considerable increase of the lumped constant in malignant tumors  resulting in overestimation of glucose metabolism if the standard value is used. In spite of these limitations  measurements of glucose metabolism with FDG are useful clinically to evaluate the prognosis of patients with brain tumors and to differentiate between late radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor. New tracers for measurement of protein synthesis  cell proliferation  and uptake of cytostatic drugs are of high clinical interest. As yet  little is known about the contribution of metabolites in brain and plasma to measured tissue activity  and differentiation between transport at the BBB and metabolism may be difficult. Therefore  the basis for accurate quantitation with these new compounds is still incomplete. Clinical reports suggest that some amino acid tracers can be used for localization and grading of brain tumors',\n",

The question is how does NAP fortify MTs? Our sequence analysis identified the MT end-binding protein (EB1)-interacting motif SxIP (SIP  Ser-Ile-Pro) in ADNP/NAP and showed specific SxIP binding sites in all members of the EB protein family (EB1-3).

       "  {'feature': \"Definition and retrospective application of a clinical scoring system for COVID-19 triage at presentationBACKGROUND: A simple scoring system for triage of suspected patients with COVID-19 is lacking. METHODS: A multi-disciplinary team developed a screening score taking into account epidemiology history, clinical feature, radiographic feature, and routine blood test. At fever clinics, the screening score was used to identify the patients with moderate to high probability of COVID-19 among all the suspected patients. The patients with moderate to high probability of COVID-19 were allocated to a single room in an isolation ward with level-3 protection. And those with low probability were allocated to a single room in a general ward with level-2 protection. At the isolation ward, the screening score was used to identify the confirmed and probable cases after two consecutive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. The data in the People's Hospital of Changshou District were used for internal validation and those in the People's Hospital of Yubei District for external validation. RESULTS: We enrolled 76 and 40 patients for internal and external validation, respectively. In the internal validation cohort, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC) was 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-0.99] for the diagnosis of moderate to high probability of cases among all the suspected patients. Using 60 as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 93%, respectively. In the isolation ward, the AUC was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83-0.99) for the diagnosis of confirmed and probable cases. Using 90 as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 100%, respectively. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The scoring system provides a reference on COVID-19 triage in fever clinics to reduce misdiagnosis and consumption of protective supplies.

The persistence of these symptoms 1 month after recovery was also documented. BACKGROUND: Headaches are a very common symptom of viral infections. Surprisingly, early Chinese studies reported a relatively low prevalence (12-15%) of headaches associated with Covid-19. METHODS: All the patients with laboratory-confirmed or chest-CT-confirmed Covid-19 infection, diagnosed between February 27th and April 15th , 2020 in the dedicated laboratory of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital were followed for 1 month after recovery. RESULTS: A total of 139 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 48.5 [15.3] years; 87 women [62.6%]) were interviewed 1 month after disappearance of fever and dyspnea (semi-structured phone interview). Overall, 59.0% (82/139) of people with Covid-19 had mild disease, 36.7% (51/139) had severe disease, and 4.3% (6/139) had critical illness. Eighty-two (59.0%; 95% CI: 50.3 to 67.3) reported new headaches during the acute phase and 3.6% (5/139) had persistent headaches 1 month after fever and dyspnea remission. Anosmia and ageusia were also very common, occurring in 60.4% (84/139) and 58.3% (81/139) of the patients, respectively. These 2 symptoms persisted in 14.4% (20/139) and 11.5% (16/139) of Covid-19 patients 1 month after recovery. Headaches were neither clearly associated with anosmia, nor with ageusia, and were not associated with disease severity (ie, requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit).

We review 12 successfully placed PTEG catheters at our institution over four years. Background: Patients unable to receive percutaneous fluoroscopic gastrostomy (PFG) catheters are at risk for developing long-term complications from indwelling nasogastric (NG) tubes. PTEG catheters are a feasible alternative offering palliative relief for patients needing either venting or feeding support. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Once adequate sedation is achieved  a guidewire is passed through an existing NG tube  which is subsequently removed. A 25 mm x 4 cm balloon catheter is then advanced into the stomach. The balloon is insufflated with contrast and withdrawn under fluoroscopy to just below the thoracic inlet. An appropriate access site is chosen on the lower left neck  and a 21-gauge needle is used to puncture the balloon under ultrasound guidance. A 0.018'' microwire is passed through the needle and coiled in the balloon. The balloon and microwire are then passed  in tandem  into the gastric lumen and the balloon is disengaged from the microwire. The neck access is then sequentially dilated to accommodate a 14-French  45-cm Mac Lock catheter (Cook  Bloomington  IN)  which is passed into the stomach or jejunum and used for venting or feeding  as appropriate. In our experience  the most commonly encountered malignancy in need of an alternative gastrostomy approach has been metastatic gastric carcinoma (67%)  ovarian carcinoma (17%)  esophageal carcinoma (8%)  and gallbladder carcinoma (8%). Patients survived 40.5 days (mean  range 28-85 days) following placement. Conclusion and/or Teaching Points: PTEG catheters are an essential tool for an interventional radiologist  providing patients an alternative for feeding or venting when direct percutaneous access into the stomach or jejunum is contraindicated.\",\n",

Clinical features of expansion positive cases are described. Cortical excitability studies used novel threshold tracking transcranal magnetic stimulation techniques with motor evoked responses recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of large clinical cohorts identified C9ORF72 expansions in 38.5% (72/187) of ALS families and 3.5% (21/606) of sporadic ALS cases. Two expansion positive families were known to carry reported ANG mutations  possibly implicating an oligogenic model of ALS. 6% of familial ALS cases with C9ORF72 expansions were also diagnosed with dementia. The penetrance of ALS was 50% at age 58 years in male subjects and 63 years in female subjects. 100% penetrance of ALS was observed in male subjects by 86 years  while 6% of female subjects remained asymptomatic at age 82 years. Gender specific differences in age of onset were evident  with male subjects significantly more likely to develop ALS at a younger age. Importantly  features of cortical hyperexcitability were apparent in C9ORF72-linked familial ALS as demonstrated by significant reduction in short interval intracortical inhibition and cortical silent period duration along with an increase in intracortical facilitation and motor evoked potential amplitude  indicating that cortical hyperexcitability is an intrinsic process in C9ORF72-linked ALS.',\n",

Here we conducted a study of differences in WM volume across the adult age span and in AD employing a newly developed  automated method for regional parcellation of the subcortical WM that uses curvature landmarks and gray matter (GM)/WM surface boundary information. This procedure measures the volume of gyral WM  utilizing a distance constraint to limit the measurements from extending into the centrum semiovale. Regional estimates were first established to be reliable across two scan sessions in 20 young healthy individuals. Next  the method was applied to a large clinically-characterized sample of 299 individuals including 73 normal older adults and 91 age-matched participants with very mild to mild AD. The majority of measured regions showed a decline in volume with increasing age  with strong effects found in bilateral fusiform  lateral orbitofrontal  superior frontal  medial orbital frontal  inferior temporal  and middle temporal WM. The association between WM volume and age was quadratic in many regions suggesting that WM volume loss accelerates in advanced aging. A number of WM regions were further reduced in AD with parahippocampal  entorhinal  inferior parietal and rostral middle frontal WM showing the strongest AD-associated reductions. There were minimal sex effects after correction for intracranial volume  and there were associations between ventricular volume and regional WM volumes in the older adults and AD that were not apparent in the younger adults. Certain results  such as the loss of WM in the fusiform region with aging  were unexpected and provide novel insight into patterns of age associated neural and cognitive decline. Overall  these results demonstrate the utility of automated regional WM measures in revealing the distinct patterns of age and AD associated volume loss that may contribute to cognitive decline.\",\n",

Numerous neuropathological and neuroimaging studies indicate that at least one-third of AD cases are complicated by some degree of vascular pathology  whereas in a similar proportion of patients clinically diagnosed with vascular dementia  AD pathology is also present. Many classical vascular risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia have recently been shown also to increase the risk of AD. Growing evidence suggests that vascular pathology lowers the threshold for the clinical presentation of dementia at a given level of AD-related pathology and potentially directly promotes AD lesions such as A beta plaques. Cerebral ischemia  chronically up-regulates expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)  which is the precursor to the amyloid beta peptide and damages the blood-brain barrier (BBB)  affecting A beta peptide clearance from the brain. Recognition of the importance of these vascular risk factors for AD-related dementia and their treatment will be beneficial not only for preventing cardiac  cerebral  and peripheral complications of vascular disease  but also will likely have a direct impact on the occurrence of sporadic AD in older subjects.

Moreover  the assembly of these amyloid beta-proteins in the presence of a specific ganglioside was markedly suppressed by coincubation with 4396C. This study suggests that cross-seeding can occur between wild and hereditary variant-type amyloid beta-proteins despite differences in their amino acid sequences.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Seizure as the presenting symptom of COVID-19: A retrospective case seriesBACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global pandemic, with over 1.8 million confirmed cases worldwide to date. Preliminary reports suggest that the disease may present in diverse ways, including with neurological symptoms, but few published reports in the literature describe seizures in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize the risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes of seizures in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series. Cases were identified through a review of admissions and consultations to the neurology and neurocritical care services between April 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. SETTING: The study setting was in a tertiary care, safety-net hospital in Boston, MA. PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting with seizures and COVID-19 during the study period were included in the study. RESULTS: Seven patients met inclusion criteria (5 females, 71%). Patients ranged in age from 37 to 88years (median: 75years). Three patients had a prior history of well-controlled epilepsy (43%), while 4 patients had new-onset seizures, including 2 patients with prior history of remote stroke. Three patients had no preceding symptoms of COVID-19 prior to presentation (57%), and in all cases, seizures were the symptom that prompted presentation to the emergency department, regardless of prior symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Provoking factors for seizures in patients with COVID-19 may include metabolic factors, systemic illness, and possibly direct effects of the virus. In endemic areas with community spread of COVID-19, clinicians should be vigilant for the infection in patients who present with seizures, which may precede respiratory symptoms or prompt presentation to medical care. Early testing, isolation, and contact tracking of these patients can prevent further transmission of the virus. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.',\n",

CT-scan is considered the diagnostic tool of choice in advanced VPGI. The incidence of a false-negative result using CT is relatively high  especially in the presence of low-grade infections. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) scanning has been suggested as an alternative for the diagnosis and assessment of infectious processes. Hybrid (18)F-FDG PET/CT has established the role of (18)F-FDG PET for the assessment of suspected VPGI  providing accurate anatomic localization of the site of infection. However  there are no clear guidelines for the interpretation of the uptake patterns of (18)F-FDG as clinical tool for VPGI. Based on the available literature it is suggested that a linear  diffuse  and homogeneous uptake should not be regarded as an infection whereas focal or heterogeneous uptake with a projection over the vessel on CT is highly suggestive of infection. Nevertheless  (18)F-FDG PET and (18)F-FDG PET/CT can play an important role in the detection of VPGI and monitoring response to treatment. However an accurate uptake and pattern recognition is warranted and cut-off uptake values and patterns need to be standardized before considering the technique to be the new standard.',\n",

We show  by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  in situ hybridization and Western blotting  that TTR exhibits a pattern of adult male-specific  leftward distribution in the mouse brain. This asymmetry appeared to be mainly due to the asymmetric distribution of the choroid plexus cells in the ventricles. Unlike the normal mice  however  the hemispheric levels of TTR transcripts of 2- and 6-month-old Tg2576 mice  a transgenic AD mouse model overexpressing Abeta  were symmetric in both sexes. Furthermore  at the age of 10 months when the pathological AD-like features had developed  the level of TTR transcripts in the left hemisphere of the male Tg2576 became significantly lower than the right one. This lowering of TTR transcript is accompanied with a higher Abeta level in the left hemisphere of the 10-month Tg2576 males. Finally  for both genders  the TTR transcript levels in the two hemispheres of aged Tg2576 mice were lower than either the adult Tg2576 or the aged nontransgenic controls. Based on the above  we suggest scenarios to correlate the changes in the levels and hemispheric patterns of TTR expression to the pathogenesis of AD.\",\n",

[French]Objective: To assess the feasibility and actual performance of ultrasound control in verification of the correct positioning of a nasogastric tube in pre-hospital settings. Study type: Prospective  observational  single-centre study. Patients and methods: Correct positioning of nasogastric tubes in patients intubated in a pre-hospital setting was verified by ultrasound and routinely compared with the results of two pre-hospital tests  namely a test involving insufflation of air through a syringe coupled with epigastric auscultation and a test involving aspiration of gastric fluid with a syringe. Routine x-ray control was carried out and compared with the pre-hospital results. Results: Ninety-six patients were included. Mean age was 52 years (median: 53.5 years  SD: 23 years). In 83% of the patients (. n=. 80)  the nasogastric tube was located by ultrasound immediately during the insertion procedure. The mean times to ultrasound confirmation of correct positioning of the nasogastric tube were 7. s (median: 2. s; SD: 16. s) and 19. s for the syringe tests (median 19. s  SD: 5. s). Eight ultrasound control tests were negative. Location coupled with insufflation of air through a syringe allowed detection of the nasogastric tube in the stomach but without providing confirmation of the actual gastric position. The pre-hospital ultrasound results were confirmed by subsequent radiological controls at the hospital. Conclusion: The ultrasound test performed in our study to verify correct positioning of a nasogastric tube is feasible in a pre-hospital setting. This technique is rapid and non-irradiating and is more sensitive and specific than the syringe tests commonly used in pre-hospital settings  and it may be performed in place of the latter tests. © 2012 Societe francaise d'anesthesie et de reanimation (Sfar).\",\n",

The present study was conducted to elucidate the relationship between the CVLs and vascular risk factors (VRFs) in elderly Japanese patients with AD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The CVLs such as lacunar infarcts  old microbleeds (OMBs)  white matter lesions (WMLs)  and occlusive vascular lesions on MRI were analyzed in relation to the risk factors in 120 Japanese patients with probable AD. Their mean age was 75.6 years. The subjects were divided into two age groups: young-old group (YOG) consisting of 55 cases being younger than 75 years and old-old group (OOG) consisting of 65 cases being 75 years or older. RESULTS: In overall analysis  10 cases (8.3%) showed brain atrophy without CVLs on MRI  46 cases (38.3%) showed WMLs in addition to the brain atrophy  61 cases (50.8%) showed lacunar lesions  and 3 cases (2.5%) were diagnosed as having a superficial siderosis. Lacunar infarcts and OMBs were more frequently observed in OOG than in YOG  and were also more frequently observed in those with 2 or more VRFs than those with less than 2 VRFs (p<0.05). The WMLs were more pronounced in OOG  and in those with more VRFs. CONCLUSION: The CVLs including lacunes  WMLs  and OMBs were present more than 90% of elderly Japanese patients with AD.

We examined functional connectivity between four homologous temporal  frontal  and occipital regions. These regions were selected to represent sites of AD neuropathology  sites of donepezil-related brain activation change in prior studies  and sites that are minimally affected by the pathologic changes of AD. Based on previous findings of selective  localized frontal responses to donepezil  we predicted that frontal connectivity would be most strongly impacted by treatment. Of the areas examined  we found that treatment had a significant effect only on functional connectivity between right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Implications for understanding the impact of donepezil treatment on brain functioning and behavior in patients with AD are discussed. This preliminary report suggests that fcMRI may provide a useful index of treatment outcome in diseases affecting brain connectivity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with constant complete LBBB were included. A same-day rest-stress protocol was used  and dipyridamole stress (14 patients) or treadmill exercise (6 patients) was applied. Electrocardiograph (ECG)-gated SPECT images were acquired 15 minutes after the administration of 0.31 mCi/kg Tc-99m sestamibi at peak stress. Regional myocardial perfusion was analyzed in relation to the cardiac cycle. RESULTS: Eleven of 14 patients who underwent a dipyridamole stress test had hypoactivity in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery territory in the ungated (summed) stress-rest images (abnormality ratio  78%). On the ungated images  the abnormality was completely reversible in one patient (9%)  partially reversible in five patients (46%)  irreversible in two patients (18%)  and reverse perfusion was identified in three patients (27%). Abnormality ratios of end-systolic and end-diastolic data were 93% and 29%  respectively. Conversely  the ungated rest-stress and end-systolic images of all the patients who performed treadmill exercise were abnormal despite the presence of normal or nearly normal end-diastolic myocardial perfusion. The angiographic findings correlated best with those of end-diastolic images. In 13 patients without coronary artery disease  normal or nearly normal regional perfusion was observed on end-diastole  but four patients with abnormal end-diastolic perfusion  which involved the LAD territory in all but one  had substantial coronary artery disease. The number of the involved segments was similar on the end-systolic and ungated data. Most of these artifactual defects were localized to the anteroseptal  septal  and inferoseptal segments. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data indicate that end-diastolic images can significantly reduce artifactual defects in patients with LBBB. The resolution of an LBBB pattern on end-diastolic data would significantly improve the diagnostic role of myocardial perfusion studies in these patients.',\n",

The debilitating cognitive and behavioral symptoms characteristic of AD make it an extremely distressing illness for patients and carers. Although drugs have been developed to treat AD symptoms and to slow disease progression  there is currently no cure. The incidence of AD is predicted to increase to over one hundred million by 2050  placing a heavy burden on communities and economies  and making the development of effective therapies an urgent priority. Two proteins are thought to have major contributory roles in AD: the microtubule associated protein tau  also known as MAPT; and the amyloid-beta peptide (A-beta)  a cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Oxidative stress is also implicated in AD pathology from an early stage. By targeting eIF4A  an RNA helicase involved in translation initiation  the synthesis of APP and tau  but not neuroprotective proteins  can be simultaneously and specifically reduced  representing a novel avenue for AD intervention. We also show that protection from oxidative stress is increased upon eIF4A inhibition. We demonstrate that the reduction of these proteins is not due to changes in mRNA levels or increased protein degradation  but is a consequence of translational repression conferred by inhibition of the helicase activity of eIF4A. Inhibition of eIF4A selectively and simultaneously modulates the synthesis of proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease: reducing A-beta and tau synthesis  while increasing proteins predicted to be neuroprotective.\",\n",

Until a few years ago it was deemed inescapable, as all the conventional medications used to treat the disease have been proven of little benefit in preventing recurrence after surgical treatment. In the past few years, anti-TNF agents given immediately after surgery have shown a remarkable efficacy in the prevention of disease recurrence. Large, randomized, controlled trials are currently underway to confirm these findings. Anti-TNF treatment of endoscopic lesions that occur after surgery seems to be less effective than using TNF antagonists to prevent recurrence. However, although the data are limited, this treatment strategy seems to be still superior to all the other prevention strategies that are not based on anti-TNF agents. Limited data are available on long-term outcomes of patients treated with anti-TNF agents after surgery. They suggest that these medications are safe and effective after many years of treatment. In addition, these agents might prevent recurrence even at doses lower than those used in patients with Crohn's disease who have not had surgery. ﾂｩ 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

METHODS: A total of 679 elderly persons without dementia underwent brain MRI. WMH and infarcts were quantified using research methods. WMH was adjusted for total cranial volume. The Petersen criteria were used to define MCI. MCI was further subclassified into amnestic and non-amnestic. We used logistic regression to relate WMH and infarcts to prevalent MCI. RESULTS: WMH were associated with amnestic MCI (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1  3.4) but not non-amnestic MCI (OR = 1.2; 95% CI 0.4  1.6) after adjusting for age  gender  ethnic group  education  and APOE-epsilon4.

Intrathecal antibodies to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) were also sought as DNA of this virus has been detected previously in a high proportion of Alzheimer's disease brains.

A raised antibody index to HHV6 was detected in 22% of the Alzheimer's disease patients and in no normals  so presumably this virus either did not reactivate in brain or it elicited only short-lived intrathecal antibodies. The HSV1 results confirm the original PCR findings that show the presence of HSV1 DNA sequences in many elderly brains  and indicate also that the whole functional HSV1 genome is present  and that the virus has replicated.\",\n",

The mean follow-up time was 36 +/- 17days. 82.5% of participants in the Intervention group survived COVID-19, compared to only 44.4% in the Comparator group (P = 0.023). The full-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality according to vitamin D3 supplementation was HR = 0.11[95%CI:0.03;0.48],P = 0.003. Kaplan-Meier distributions showed that Intervention group had longer survival time than Comparator group (log-rank P = 0.002). Finally, vitamin D3 supplementation was inversely associated with OSCI score for COVID-19 (beta=-3.84[95%CI:-6.07;-1.62], P = 0.001). In conclusion, bolus vitamin D3 supplementation during or just before COVID-19 was associated in frail elderly with less severe COVID-19 and better survival rate. Copyright Â© 2020.

Despite a massive shift in health care resources, cerebrovascular disease continues to be a substantial burden. We review the first 10 patients undergoing thrombectomy following a series of governmental and institutional policy changes diverting resources to the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Ten patients with emergent large-vessel occlusion underwent thrombectomy between March 23 and April 1, 2020. Five patients tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Successful reperfusion was achieved in 9 of 10 patients, at a median time of 37 minutes from vascular access. The postprocedural NIHSS score improved by an average of 7.7 points. Of the 5 patients positive for COVID-19, none have experienced a critical respiratory illness. We report the early incidence of COVID-19 positivity in patients with emergent large-vessel occlusion and demonstrate that thrombectomy continues to be an efficacious option, as well as safe for health care providers.

       "  {'feature': \"Comparison of saliva and oro-nasopharyngeal swab sample in the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel are at risk of becoming infected while taking upper and/or lower respiratory tract specimens. Therefore, there is a need for sampling methods that do not risk infecting them. In this study, we aimed to compare the saliva and Oro-Nasopharyngeal Swab (ONS) sampling methods. METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 included patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Group 2 included patients with COVID-19 compatible findings in lung computed tomography (CT), but with a negative PCR. Group 3 included patients who presented to the emergency department with COVID-19 compatible complaints but had normal CT. Saliva and ONS samples were taken on the third day of hospitalization in groups 1 and 2, whereas in group 3, they were taken at the time of admission to the hospital. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included in the study. The average age was 51.04 +/- 17.9 years, and 37 (57.8%) were male. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27 (42.2%) patients' saliva samples. While the sensitivity and positive predictive value of saliva samples were 85.2%, specificity and negative predictive value were 89.2%. The value of kappa was in substantial agreement (0.744), and it was found statistically significant (<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Saliva samples can be used instead of ONS samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Investigating SARS-CoV-2 with saliva is cheaper, easier for the patient and overall, and, most importantly, it poses much less risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination to healthcare personnel.\",\n",

This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95). The hazard ratios of PGV and PCV were 1.39 (95% CI 1.05~1.84, P=0.023) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.17~2.38, P=0.005), respectively. CT features, adjusted for age and gender, on day 4 and in terms of changes from day 0 to day 4 outperformed APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer. Conclusions: CT quantification of pneumonia lesions can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness, providing a promising prognostic indicator for clinical management of COVID-19.

We present a rare case of fulminant COVID-19 associated with reverse-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy (RTCC) that improved with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old previous healthy male presented in the emergency room with 4 days of dry cough, chest pain, myalgias and fatigue. He progressed to ARF requiring high-flow-nasal-cannula (flow: 60 L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen: 40%). Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed COVID-19 and chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates. Biochemistry suggested CRS: increased C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and interleukin-6. Renal function was normal but lactate levels were elevated. Electrocardiogram demonstrated non-specific changes and troponin-I levels were slightly elevated. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) basal and midventricular akinesia with apex sparing (LV ejection fraction: 30%) and depressed cardiac output (2.8 L/min) consistent with a rare variant of stress-related cardiomyopathy: RTCC. His ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen was < 120. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, plus antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), and prophylactic anticoagulation. Infusion of milrinone failed to improve his cardiogenic shock (day-1). Thus, rescue TPE was performed using the Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA) without protective antibodies. Over 5 days he received daily TPE (each lasting 4 hours). His lactate levels, oxygenation, and LV function normalized and he was weaned off vasopressors. His inflammation markers improved, and he was extubated on day-7. RT-PCR was negative on day-17. He was discharged to home isolation in good condition. CONCLUSION: Stress-cardiomyopathy may complicate the course of fulminant COVID-19 with associated CRS. If inotropic therapy fails, TPE without protective antibodies may help rescue the critically ill patient.',\n",

Human-to-human transmission mainly occurs through droplets, but viral RNA clearance in different biological fluids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. We aimed to correlate the presence and the relevant temporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in biological specimens (stool, urine, blood, and tears) of the transmission with clinical/epidemiological features in patients with COVID-19. We focused on the time window between the positivity of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from different specimens. We used the Mantel-Cox log rank test to verify the differences in terms of viral shedding duration, while we employed the Mann-Whitney U-test for subgroup analysis. This review protocol was registered with PROSPERO number: CRD42020183629. We identified 147 studies; we included 55 (1,348 patients) for epidemiological analysis, of which we included 37 (364 patients) for statistical analysis. The most frequently used specimens other than respiratory tract swabs were stool samples (or anal/rectal swabs), with a positivity rate of 48.8%, followed by urine samples, with a positivity rate of 16.4%; blood samples showed a positivity rate of 17.5%. We found that fecal positivity duration (median 19 days) was significantly (p < 0.001) longer than respiratory tract positivity (median 14 days). Limited data are available about the other specimens. In conclusion, medical and social communities must pay close attention to negativization criteria for COVID-19, because patients could have longer alternative viral shedding.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Morone, Palomba, Iosa, Caporaso, De Angelis, Venturiero, Savo, Coiro, Carbone, Gimigliano, Iolascon and Paolucci.',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"A novel Rac1 GAP splice variant relays poly-Ub accumulation signals to mediate Rac1 inactivation.Spatial control of RhoGTPase-inactivating GAP components remains largely enigmatic. We describe a brain-specific RhoGAP splice variant  BARGIN (BGIN)  which comprises a combination of BAR  GAP  and partial CIN phosphatase domains spliced from adjacent SH3BP1 and CIN gene loci. Excision of BGIN exon 2 results in recoding of a 42-amino acid N-terminal stretch. The partial CIN domain is a poly-ubiquitin (poly-Ub)-binding module that facilitates BGIN distribution to membranous and detergent-insoluble fractions. Poly-Ub/BGIN interactions support BGIN-mediated inactivation of a membranous Rac1 population  which consequently inactivates membrane-localized Rac1 effector systems such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the Nox1 complex. Given that Ub aggregate pathology and proteotoxicity are central themes in various neurodegenerative disorders  we investigated whether BGIN/Rac1 signaling could be involved in neurodegenerative proteotoxicity. BGIN/Ub interactions are observed through colocalization in tangle aggregates in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Moreover  enhanced BGIN membrane distribution correlates with reduced Rac1 activity in AD brain tissue. Finally  BGIN contributes to Rac1 inhibition and ROS generation in an amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteotoxicity model. These results suggest that BGIN/poly-Ub interactions enhance BGIN membrane distribution and relay poly-Ub signals to enact Rac1 inactivation  and attenuation of Rac1 signaling is partially dependent on BGIN in a proteotoxic APP context.\",\n",

No consistent relationship was found between SCE and WMH in AD. In VaD  the severity of DWMH was negatively correlated with SCE (beta = -0.55; p = 0.001). In conclusion  the presence of a significant venous-to-arterial shunt is associated with more severe DWMH in AD  and may play a part in the aetiology of the disorder. In addition  there is a significant negative correlation between SCE and DWMH in VaD  which supports the hypothesis that VaD may be the result of ischaemic injury  predominantly reflecting embolic aetiology.',\n",

Although its cellular production has been studied extensively  little is known about Abeta clearance. Recently  insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)  a 110-kDa metalloendopeptidase  was found to degrade both endogenously secreted and synthetic Abeta peptides. Surprisingly  IDE-mediated proteolysis of [(125)I]Abeta(1-40) in microglial cell-culture media was accompanied by the formation of (125)I-labelled peptides with higher apparent molecular masses  raising the possibility that the degradation products act as 'seeds' for Abeta oligomerization. To directly address the role of IDE in Abeta degradation and oligomerization  we investigated the action of purified recombinant wild-type and catalytically inactive IDEs. Our data demonstrate that (i) IDE alone is sufficient to cleave purified Abeta that is either unlabelled  iodinated or (35)S-labelled; (ii) the initial cleavage sites are His(14)-Gln(15)  Phe(19)-Phe(20) and Phe(20)-Ala(21); and (iii) incubation of IDE with [(125)I]Abeta  but not with [(35)S]-Abeta  leads to the formation of slower migrating species on gels. Since iodination labels N-terminal fragments of Abeta  and (35)S labels C-terminal products  we analysed unlabelled synthetic fragments of Abeta and determined that only the N-terminal fragments migrate with anomalously high molecular mass. These results indicate that IDE alone is sufficient to degrade Abeta at specific sites  and that its degradation products do not promote oligomerization of the intact Abeta peptide.\",\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present prospective single-centre study included consecutive symptomatic patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-proven COVID-19 who were not in the intensive care unit. All patients were assessed using HRCT and ultrasound of the lungs by distinct operators blinded to each other's findings. The number of areas (0-12) with B-lines and/or consolidations was evaluated using ultrasound and compared to the percentage and classification (absent or limited, <10%; moderate, 10-25%; extensive, 25-50%; severe, 50-75%; critical, >75%) of lung involvement on chest HRCT. RESULTS: Data were analysed for 21 patients with COVID-19 (median [range] age 65 [37-90] years, 76% male) and excellent correlation was found between the ultrasound score for B-lines and the classification (p<0.01) and percentage of lung involvement on chest HRCT (r=0.935, p<0.001). In addition, the ultrasound score correlated positively with supplemental oxygen therapy (r=0.45, p=0.041) and negatively with minimal oxygen saturation at ambient air (r=-0.652, p<0.01).

Telemedicine was hardly used in epilepsy, and patients and neurologists usually preferred onsite visits. Our goal was to study impressions of adult and pediatric epileptologists about the use of telemedicine after emergent implementation during the new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was sent to the members of the Spanish Epilepsy Society and the members of the Epilepsy Study Group of the Catalan Neurological Society, inquiring about different aspects of telemedicine in epilepsy during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 66 neurologists responded, mostly adult neurologists (80.3%), the majority with a monographic epilepsy clinic (4 out of 5). Of all respondents, 59.1% reported to attend more than 20 patients with epilepsy (PWE) a week. During the pandemic, respondents handled their epilepsy clinics mainly with telephone calls (88%); only 4.5% used videoconference. Changes in antiseizure medications were performed less frequently than during onsite visits by 66.6% of the epileptologists. Scales were not administered during these visits, and certain types of information such as sudden expected unrelated death in epilepsy (SUDEP) were felt to be more appropriate to discuss in person. More than 4 out of 5 of the neurologists (84.8%) stated that they would be open to perform some telematic visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, emergent implantation of teleneurology has shown to be appropriate for the care of many PWE.

Some diseases, for instance diabetes, is continuously suggested as a risk factor which contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no comprehensive studies aiming to explain the exact relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. Thus, this study aims to summarize the evidence about diabetes and COVID-19 outbreak through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHOD: A literature review was implemented within databases of Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, and Web of science. Observational reviews, case-report, and case-series studies that assessed the diabetes in COVID-19 patients, were included. Data extraction and assessment were guided by PRISMA checklist. FINDINGS: Some studies suggest that there were no significant differences in symptoms between patients who suffered from both diabetes and COVID-19 and those who only suffered COVID-19. In the subsequent meta-analysis 14.5 % of the subjects were diabetic patient. These clients have poor ARDS prognosis, severe symptoms, and the death rate is higher among COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is suggested the diabetic patients will be treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and HCQ. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that diabetes is a risk factor - and contributes to the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19.

We hypothesized that in vivo measurements of lactate (lac)  a by-product of glycolysis  would correlate with functional impairment and measures of brain health in a cohort of 15 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) individuals. Lac was quantified from the precuneus/posterior cingulate (PPC) using 2-dimensional J-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

PPC lac was negatively correlated with performance on the Wechsler logical memory tests and on the minimental state examination even after accounting for gray matter  cerebral spinal fluid volume  and age. No such relationships were observed between lac and performance on nonmemory tests. Significant negative relationships were also noted between PPC lac and hippocampal volume and PPC functional connectivity. Together  these results reveal that aMCI individuals with a greater disease progression have increased concentrations of PPC lac. Because lac is upregulated as a compensatory response to mitochondrial impairment  we propose that J-resolved MRS of lac is a noninvasive  surrogate biomarker of impaired metabolic function and would provide a useful means of tracking mitochondrial function during therapeutic trials targeting brain metabolism.\",\n",

DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. SETTING: Tertiary cardiac referral centre. PATIENTS: 22 patients with sick sinus syndrome and indications for permanent dual chamber pacing; 20 healthy individuals as controls. INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent myocardial imaging with planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after an intravenous infusion of 5 mCi 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) before and after pacemaker implantation. A SPECT thallium201 myocardial study was done during the same week as the 123I-MIBG study in all patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio and washout rate were calculated during the 123I-MIBG study to assess the global cardiac sympathetic activity; the aim of the SPECT study was to investigate the regional distribution of adrenergic innervation. RESULTS: The H/M ratio was significantly smaller in the patients with sick sinus syndrome than in the controls (p < 0.001). In sick sinus syndrome there were regional adrenergic innervation defects  mostly in the inferior and apical walls. After a medium term pacing period  a redistribution of 123I-MIBG uptake was detected  with deterioration of adrenergic innervation in the inferior  apical  and posterior walls. The thallium201 myocardial perfusion study showed no change after three months of permanent pacing. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sick sinus syndrome have global and regional disturbances of the adrenergic innervation of the left ventricular myocardium. These seem to deteriorate as a result of asynchronous electrical activation. The clinical significance of this finding requires further investigation.',\n",

It remains unclear where in the brain it exerts its effect. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to measure changes in brain function and relate these to cognition. OBJECTIVES: To use fMRI to study brain activation with rivastigmine treatment. METHODS: The effect on brain activation of a single dose of rivastigmine was tested in seven patients with mild Alzheimer's disease using fMRI during face encoding  and in five patients during a parametric working memory task. RESULTS: During face encoding  rivastigmine increased bilateral activation in the fusiform gyrus. Brain activation was also enhanced in the prefrontal cortex in a simple working memory task. When working memory load was further increased  not only was increased activation seen  but in certain areas there was also decreased activation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings link the previously observed increase in cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease after treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor to altered brain activation. Although the results cannot be generalised to the Alzheimer's disease population at large  they provide evidence that in mild Alzheimer's disease  rivastigmine enhances brain activation in the fusiform and frontal cortices. This is compatible with the concept of cholinergic circuitry.\",\n",

Statistical analyze showed that the subpleural area is the priority distribution location (14/14) and the sign inclined to perform in those patients in a relatively early stage (6/8) and with moderate clinical severity (8/8). Segment VI in lower lobe involved most (6/14). In this retrospective study, other characteristic radiologic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed synchronously. A series of radiologic signs were identified in bilateral lungs with a bias towards segment VI, I + II and X. Segment VI had the largest number of each sign. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs), subpleural distribution pattern and vessels dilatation were the top three most common signs among them. Conclusions: The recognition of the arch bridge sign may benefit patient care by earlier definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The lesions of COVID-19 pneumonia distributed mainly in the back-lung segments, which characteristic may light new ideas in clinical treatment and nursing strategy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 23 AD patients and 18 age-matched normal controls who underwent magnetic resonance imaging using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTT of PCFTs was generated from DTI. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in co-registered voxels along with DTT of PCFTs. Student's t-test was used to compare results between the AD patients and normal controls. RESULTS: The MD in PCFTs was significantly higher in AD patients than in normal controls (P = 0.019). The FA in PCFTs was significantly lower in AD patients than in normal controls (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The abnormal MD increase and FA decrease  which is considered to indicate a net loss of barriers that restrict water molecular motion and tissue anisotropy of white matter  is consistent with neuropathological data that demonstrate partial loss of myelin  axons  and oligodendrial cells in white matter of AD brains. Our results suggest that MD and FA reflect progression of AD-related histopathological changes in the PCFTs and may represent a useful biological index for monitoring AD.\",\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chest CT images of 72 symptomatic patients with corona virus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed retrospectively, including 44 younger patients (47.5+/-8.7 y old) and 28 older patients (68.4+/-6.0 y old). CT findings including density (pure ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with consolidation, consolidation), the number of lobes involved, lesion distribution, and the main accompanying signs were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Characteristic CT findings included the lobes of bilateral lung extensively involved, ground-glass opacity and ground-glass opacity with consolidation in the peripheral area, sometimes accompanied by interlobular septal thickening, and subpleural line and pleural thickening. Compared with the younger group, the proportion of extensive involvement of lung lobes was higher in the elderly group (71.4% vs. 36.4%, P=0.009), and subpleural line and pleural thickening were more likely to occur (50.0% vs. 25.0%, and 71.4% vs. 40.9%, P=0.030 and 0.011, respectively).

Patients and Methods: We reviewed clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data for all patients that underwent surgery within the neurosurgery department from March 26th to April 22nd 2020. We collected demographic information, comorbidities, pre-operative COVID-19 test result, whether COVID-19 respiratory or other symptoms were developed during hospitalization, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, and result of post-operative COVID-19 test. Results: Using a combination of both preoperative outpatient COVID-19 drive-through and inpatient testing to obtain surgical clearance with selected telemedicine evaluations, 103 non-elective neurosurgical procedures were performed on 102 patients. No patients tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 testing obtained 48h prior to surgery. None of the patients developed any COVID-19 symptoms during their hospitalization or were re-admitted to our ED postoperatively for COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: We describe a multi-faceted preoperative triage protocol for safely performing non-elective neurosurgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could help other neurosurgical departments and hospitals minimize coronavirus exposure for patients and healthcare workers. We believe this triage strategy could be implemented at other centers to gradually restart a process towards elective surgeries in a safe way. Copyright .',\n",

It has been observed that the neurons containing calbindin D28K (CB) may in certain circumstances be more resistant to excitotoxic and ischemic injury. In the present study the susceptibility of hippocampal neurons containing CB to develop NFT was studied  and the distribution of CB cells was compared with hippocampal plaque density in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Interestingly CB-positive hippocampal neurons did not contain tangles and could be seen next to degenerating tau-positive pyramidal cells. Comparison of the hippocampal plaque distribution with that of CB neurons showed that in general CB-positive neurons were found in areas with a low plaque burden. Further comparison of cases with differing degrees of severity indicated that CB-positive neurons were relatively preserved in cases with moderate plaque and tangle content but that in severe cases the CB-positive pyramidal cells were lost. These findings indicate that CB cells may be protected in the earlier stages of the disease but that this resistance ability is lost in the late stages of AD. The observation that CB-positive pyramidal cells do not accumulate NFT suggests that proteolysis of tau differs in CB-negative and CB-positive cells.\",\n",

A meta-analysis of eligible studies comparing the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID-19 in infected hypertensive patients who were under treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted. Method(s): PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched for relevant studies. Fixed-effects models or random-effects models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates. Results and discussion: A total of eighteen studies with 17 311 patients were included. The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a significant 16% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73-0.95), P =.007, I2 = 65%. What is new and conclusion: The results of this pooled analysis suggest that the use of ACEI/ARB does not worsen the prognosis of COVID-19, and could even be protective in hypertensive subjects.

In order to improve local tumor control rates with radiotherapy high doses to the tumor volume are frequently necessary. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) is used to denote a spectrum of radiation planning and delivery techniques that rely on three-dimensional imaging to define the target (tumor) and to distinguish it from normal tissues. Modern  high-precision radiotherapy (RT) techniques are needed in order to implement the goal of optimal tumor destruction delivering minimal dose to the non-target normal tissues. A better target definition is nowadays possible with contemporary imaging (computerized tomography  magnetic resonance imaging  and positron emission tomography) and image registration technology. A highly precise dose distributions can be obtained with optimal 3-D CRT treatment delivery techniques such as stereotactic RT  intensity modulated RT (IMRT)  or protontherapy (the latter allowing for in-depth conformation). Patient daily set-up repositioning and internal organ immobilization systems are necessary before considering to undertake any of the above mentioned high-precision treatment approaches. Prostate cancer  brain tumors  and base of skull malignancies are among the sites most benefitting of dose escalation approaches. Nevertheless  a significant dose reduction to the normal tissues in the vicinity of the irradiated tumor also achievable with optimal 3-D CRT may also be a major issue in the treatment of pediatric tumors in order to preserve growth  normal development  and to reduce the risk of developing radiation induced diseases such as cancer or endocrinologic disorders. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.',\n",

Risk factors for poor outcomes in COVID-19 disease include a personal history of cancer. The purpose of this research is to explore what cancer patients (pts) know about COVID-19 and their perception of the risk of infection. Method(s): From 14th March until 4th May, a total of 33 cancer pts from the 167 admitted in the hospitalisation ward of the Medical Oncology Department of University Hospital La Fe were included. Our questionnaire is a psychometric five points Likert scale with 25 questions and 5 additional open questions. A stratified analysis by age, gender, marital status, educational background, number of previous systemic treatments and cause of hospitalisation was carried out. chi2 test, Fisher's exact test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kendall rank correlation coefficient (Tau-b statistic or Tau-c) were performed when indicated for each category. The time delay between the appearance of symptoms and the seeking of medical help at our Hospital, due to fear of COVID-19, was also analyzed. Result(s): Of the 33 pts included in the study, 22 were male and 11 female. 20 pts received one or more previous systemic therapy. Median age was 57 years old. Their responses indicated that cancer pts felt they needed more information about COVID-19 and how it could affect them. When asked about the perception of the risk of infection, most pts were afraid of coronavirus disease (63.7%) but did feel safe in both the emergency department (57.6%) and the hospitalisation area (81.8%). When pts were asked about how they felt during this hospitalisation period compared with previous ones, they claimed that the quality of care received in the hospitalisation area by both nurses and doctors had not changed from other times (84.9%), in spite of the strict measures being implemented. Previously treated cancer pts were more aware of secondary effects of antineoplastic treatment than those pts who had not received any treatment, including the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2 infection with atypical symptoms (p = 0.005). About 50% of pts did delay seeking medical help; these pts were admitted in a poorer physical condition, their hospital stays were longer and more difficulties were found in treating the oncological process; a higher risk of death was also seen. Conclusion(s): We are experiencing an extraordinary scenario have never seen before.

METHODS: A total of 48 patients with biopsy-proven anal SCC underwent FDG-PET scans at baseline and post chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy  concurrent 5-FU/mitomycin). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine survival outcomes according to FDG-PET metabolic response. RESULTS: In all  79% patients (n=38) had a complete metabolic response (CMR) at all sites of disease  15% (n=7) had a CMR in regional nodes but only partial response in the primary tumour (overall partial metabolic response (PMR)) and 6% (n=3) had progressive distant disease despite CMR locoregionally (overall no response (NR)). The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 95% for patients with a CMR  71% for PMR and 0% for NR (P<0.0001). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 88% in CMR  69% in PMR and 0% in NR (P<0.0001).

METHODS: We studied two patients with symptomatic inherited prion disease (P102L) and two pre-symptomatic P102L gene carriers using quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Short echo time spectra were acquired from the thalamus  caudate region and frontal white matter  metabolite levels and ratios were measured and z-scores calculated for individual patients relative to age-matched normal controls. MRS data were compared with structural magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: One fCJD case had generalised atrophy and showed increased levels of myo-inositol (MI) in the thalamus (z=3.7). The other had decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (z=4) and diffuse signal abnormality in the frontal white matter. Both asymptomatic gene carriers had normal imaging  but increased frontal white matter MI (z=4.3  4.1)  and one also had increased MI in the caudate (z=5.3). CONCLUSION: Isolated MI abnormalities in asymptomatic gene carriers are a novel finding and may reflect early glial proliferation  prior to significant neuronal damage. MRS provides potential non-invasive surrogate markers of early disease and progression in inherited prion disease.',\n",

We determined factors independently associated with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Among all (N=349) patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in a university hospital in a French region with a high rate of COVID-19, we analysed patients who underwent CTPA for clinical signs of severe disease (SpO2<=93% or breathing rate>=30/min); or rapid clinical worsening. Multivariable analysis was performed using Firth penalised maximum likelihood estimates. RESULTS: In total, 162 patients (46.4%) underwent CTPA (mean age 65.6+/-13.0; 67.3% males (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.5-75.5%)). PE was diagnosed in 44 patients (27.2%). Most PE were segmental and the rate of PE-related right ventricular dysfunction was 15.9%. By multivariable analysis, the only two significant predictors of CTPA-confirmed PE were D-dimer level and the lack of any anticoagulant therapy (odds ratio (OR) 4.0 (95%CI 2.4-6.7) per additional quartile, and OR 4.5 (95%CI 1.1-7.4) respectively). ROC curve analysis identified a D-dimer cut-off value of 2590 ng.mL-1 to best predict occurrence of PE (AUC: 0.88, p<0.001, sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 83.8%). D-dimer level >2590 ng.mL-1 was associated with a 17-fold increase in the adjusted risk of PE. CONCLUSION: Elevated D-dimers (>2590 ng.mL-1) and absence of anticoagulant therapy predict PE in hospitalised COVID-19 patients with clinical signs of severity. These data strengthen the evidence base in favour of systematic anticoagulation, and suggest wider use of D-dimer guided CTPA to screen for PE in acutely ill hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Here we report on the production and characterization of a line of mice transgenic for the 383 aa isoform of human tau with the P301S mutation. At 5-6 months of age  homozygous animals from this line developed a neurological phenotype dominated by a severe paraparesis. According to light microscopy  many nerve cells in brain and spinal cord were strongly immunoreactive for hyperphosphorylated tau. According to electron microscopy  abundant filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein were present. The majority of filaments resembled the half-twisted ribbons described previously in cases of FTDP-17  with a minority of filaments resembling the paired helical filaments of Alzheimer's disease. Sarkosyl-insoluble tau from brains and spinal cords of transgenic mice ran as a hyperphosphorylated 64 kDa band  the same apparent molecular mass as that of the 383 aa tau isoform in the human tauopathies. Perchloric acid-soluble tau was also phosphorylated at many sites  with the notable exception of serine 214. In the spinal cord  neurodegeneration was present  as indicated by a 49% reduction in the number of motor neurons. No evidence for apoptosis was obtained  despite the extensive colocalization of hyperphosphorylated tau protein with activated MAP kinase family members.

The approach incorporates the recently developed Self-adaptive Resource Allocation Network (SRAN) for Alzheimer's disease classification using voxel-based morphometric features of MR images. SRAN classifier uses a sequential learning algorithm  employing self-adaptive thresholds to select the appropriate training samples and discard redundant samples to prevent over-training. These selected training samples are then used to evolve the network architecture efficiently. Since  the number of features extracted from the MR images is large  a feature selection scheme (to reduce the number of features needed) using an Integer-Coded Genetic Algorithm (ICGA) in conjunction with the SRAN classifier (referred to here as the ICGA-SRAN classifier) have been developed. In this study  different healthy/Alzheimer's disease patient's MR images from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies data set have been used for the performance evaluation of the proposed ICGA-SRAN classifier. We have also compared the results of the ICGA-SRAN classifier with the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers. The study results clearly show that the ICGA-SRAN classifier produces a better generalization performance with a smaller number of features  lower misclassification rate and a compact network. The ICGA-SRAN selected features clearly indicate that the variations in the gray matter volume in the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala brain regions may be good indicators of the onset of Alzheimer's disease in normal persons.\",\n",

VCE depicted mucosal pathologies missed by MRE in three patients. MRE revealed 83 extraenteric findings in 55 patients and CGR was able to show the dynamic evolution of the gastrointestinal function. MRE is a simple, safe, non-invasive and effective method for evaluating small bowel Crohn's disease. VCE allows visualization and readily characterizes subtle mucosal lesions missed by MRE, whereas MRE yields additional mural, perienteric and extraenteric information. However, oral barium CGR utilizes radiation, which is not suitable for repeated use in children.\",\n",

The website of the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry(www.chictr.org.cn) and the American Clinical Trial Registry(clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to collect protocols of TCM for COVID-19. Documents were screened following the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted in regard to registration date, study objective, type of design, sponsor, patient, sample size, intervention, and evaluation index. Descriptive analysis was conducted. A total of 49 clinical trial protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were included. Primary sponsors were mainly hospitals or universities in places like Hubei, Beijing, Zhejiang and other regions. The implementation units are mainly in Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan and other regional hospitals. The types of study design were mainly experimental studies(40), including 30 randomized parallel controlled trials, 7 non-randomized controlled trials, 2 single arm trials and 1 consecutively recruited trial; besides, there were also 6 observational studies, 2 health service studies and 1 preventive study. The sample size reached a total of 30 562 cases, with a maximum of 20 000 for a single study and a minimum of 30.

All clinical scales were related to brain metabolism in associative temporal  parietal or frontal areas. A factorial analysis demonstrated that all scales could be classified in a single factor. That factor was highly correlated to decrease of cerebral activity in bilateral parietal and temporal cortices  precuneus  and left middle frontal gyrus. This finding suggests that global scores for all scales provided similar information on the neural substrate of dementia severity.

Based on the Italian Ministry of Health data, we reconstructed the daily course of virus-positive cases and deaths during March 2020 for whole Italy, 19 regions and 2 provinces. From February 29 to March 31 there was a 100.9-fold increase in the cumulative number of cases and a 428.6-fold increase in the number of deaths in Italy. When plotted on a semilogarithmic scale, the curves tended to diverge from linearity with 23%, 16%, and 7% average daily increases during the 3 decades of March. Similarly, the number of deaths decreased from an average daily growth of 19% during the 2nd decade to 10% during the 3rd decade. The correlation coefficients relating the days to cases or deaths during each one of the 3 decades approached the unity. As inferred from the equations of the regression lines relative to the 3 decades, the doubling times of cases were 3.4, 5.1 and 9.6 days, respectively. The doubling times of deaths during the 2nd and 3rd decades were 4.9 and 7.0 days, respectively. There was a broad geographic variability, with a striking gradient from North, where 40.8% of cases and 57.9% of deaths occurred in Lombardy, to South. On the whole, during March there was a trend to epidemic growth decline, but the time for the end of the epidemic will depend on a variety of factors and, at present, it is unpredictable.

Neurons containing BuChE are particularly located in the amygdala  hippocampal formation and the thalamus  structures involved in the normal functions of cognition and behavior that typically become compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progress of this disease is thought to result  at least in part  from the accumulation of ﾎｲ-amyloid (Aﾎｲ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. These structures characteristically become associated with cholinesterase activity  and are major determinants of AD diagnosis post-mortem. Early definitive AD diagnosis in the living brain could greatly facilitate specific timely treatment of the disorder and the search for novel drugs to preempt progress of this disease. Radioligands have been developed to detect deposition of Aﾎｲ plaques in the brain; however  since many cognitively normal individuals also exhibit Aﾎｲ plaque deposition  this approach has inherent disadvantages for definitive AD diagnosis during life. The association of BuChE with Aﾎｲ plaques appears to be a characteristic of AD. This has prompted the search for radioligands that target BuChE in association with Aﾎｲ plaques that accumulate in cortical grey matter  a region normally with very little of this enzyme activity. A number of BuChE radioligands have been synthesized and preliminary testing indicates that some such radioligands enter the brain and accumulate in regions known to contain BuChE.

The purpose of this study is to explore the emotional impact and pts\\' perception experienced who accessed to our Oncology section at University Hospital and Trust of Verona (Italy) regarding these rules. Method(s): An questionnaire was designed by our Psycho-Oncology service and administered to all pts accessing to our outpatient facilities during a 21-days period (April 9th - April 30th, 2020). Two main areas were investigated: i) organizational aspects and ii) awareness about infection risks, protective strategies, and new rules adopted (14 items, plus demographic data). Percentage of relevant answers to questionnaire items are reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Result(s): Among 241 respondents, fear of accessing hospital facilities and that chemotherapy treatment could increase the infection risk was reported to be quite high or high in 34% (95% CI: 29-41%) and 27% (95% CI: 21-33%), respectively. Awareness of disease-related risks of infection and strategies to reduce them was \"very clear\" or \"fairly clear\" [83% (95% CI: 78-88%) and 93% (95% CI: 90-96%), respectively]. Availability of medical personnel to be contacted while not in hospital was perceived as \"very high\". Almost all pts felt that organizational measures were clearly expressed (98%, 95% CI: 96-100%) and mainly obtained through the information received at the triage (73%, 95% CI: 67-79%).

In addition  many neurodegenerative disorders including prion  Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis. The effects of cholesterol balance on prion protein-mediated neurotoxicity and ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation were the focus of this study.

In addition  the PrP (106-126)-mediated increase of p53  p-p38  p-ERK and the decrease of Bcl-2 were blocked by cholesterol treatment. These results indicated that cellular cholesterol enrichment is a key regulator of PrP-106-126-mediated oxidative stress and neurotoxicity.

A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death. Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.9-2.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naive confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557 = 4.5%) and the approximator1 of deaths/deaths + recoveries (2,169/2,169 + 17,572 = 11%) as of 29 February 2020.

CONCLUSIONS: Large vessel vasculitis is a known cause of FUO. Duplex-sonography and 18F-FDG-PET are able to detect these disorders at an early stage before the onset of clinically relevant arterial obstructions. More widespread use of these techniques may show that large-vessel vasculitis is more common than previously thought.\",\n",

METHODS: This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee. A total of 82 patients with COVID-19 admitted from 10/1/2020~15/3/2020 were enrolled. RPA and perinephric fat stranding (PFS) were evaluated on NECT imaging. According to the presence of PFS, the patients were divided into two groups: Group A, 38 patients with PFS, and Group B, 44 patients without PFS. Clinical data, including age, gender, clinical classification, SCr levels, and RPA on NECT were analysed. The RPA and SCr of the two groups with COVID-19 were analysed to determine possible difference and correlation. Eighty subjects with no kidney diseases were randomly selected as control group to determine the RPA of normal kidney performed on the same CT scanner. RESULTS: Mean age, male to female ratio, number of severe and critical cases, and SCr of Group A were higher than those of Group B. Both mean RPA of Group A and Group B were lower than that of control. Mean RPA of Group A was even lower than that of Group B. A significant weak negative linear correlation between RPA on NECT and SCr in COVID-19 was indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Decrease in RPA on NECT was observed in patients with COVID-19 and a weak linear negative correlation with SCr levels was found.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine the differences in glioma extension as shown by the 2 methods  17 patients with malignant gliomas were included in this comparative imaging study: astrocytoma III: n = 6  ependymoma III: n = 1  oligodendroglioma III: n = 1  glioblastoma IV: n = 9. The tomographic image sets were matched anatomically and the slices showing maximal tumor extension were identified in both image sets respectively. Tumor spread was compared visually and the tumor extension was quantified. RESULTS: In gliomas WHO III tumor extension was delineated significantly larger by 123I-IMT-SPECT than by 201Tl-SPECT (mean +/- SD: 816 +/- 281 pixels vs 600 +/- 220 pixels  n = 8  p < 0.05). The size of glioblastomas was shown in a comparable manner by the 2 methods (977 +/- 571 vs 1.051 +/- 588  n = 9  ns  p = 0.57)  but there were considerable regional differences between the area of 201Tl uptake and amino acid retention. In the whole group a weak but significant negative correlation between intensity of 201Tl uptake on the one hand and a ratio of the area as depicted by 123I-IMT vs area as depicted by 201Tl on the other hand  was found (n = 17  r = 0.49  p < 0.05). Thus the differences in the delineation of areas became smaller with increasing 201Tl uptake. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data indicate that the extension of gliomas is depicted differently by the 2 methods. 123I-IMT-SPECT shows a larger tumor extension especially in gliomas WHO III. Since 201Tl uptake has previously been shown to correlate with disruption of the blood brain barrier  123I-IMT-SPECT may delineate tumor parts without endothelial leakage. This additional information may be helpful in planning surgical or radiation therapy. The advantages of 123I-IMT in this respect decrease with increasing 201Tl uptake and with increasing malignancy',\n",

It cannot be prevented  cured or drastically slowed  even though AD research has increased in the past 5-10 years. Instead of focusing on the brain volume or on the single brain structures like hippocampus  this paper investigates the relationship and proximity between regions in the brain and uses this information as a novel way of classifying normal control (NC)  mild cognitive impaired (MCI)  and AD subjects. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort of 528 subjects (170 NC  240 MCI  and 114 AD) from ADNI at baseline and month 12 was studied. We investigated a marker based on Procrustes aligned center of masses and the percentile surface connectivity between regions. These markers were classified using a linear discriminant analysis in a cross validation setting and compared to whole brain and hippocampus volume. RESULTS: We found that both our markers was able to significantly classify the subjects. The surface connectivity marker showed the best results with an area under the curve (AUC) at 0.877 (p<0.001)  0.784 (p<0.001)  0 766 (p<0.001) for NC-AD  NC-MCI  and MCI-AD  respectively  for the functional regions in the brain. The surface connectivity marker was able to classify MCI-converters with an AUC of 0.599 (p<0.05) for the 1-year period. CONCLUSION: Our results show that our relative proximity markers include more information than whole brain and hippocampus volume. Our results demonstrate that our proximity markers have the potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD.\",\n",

We then performed RIAT in stored serum samples from other patients who suffered laboratory-confirmed human common cold coronaviruses (n = 6) and viruses other than coronavirus (influenza virus, n = 3; rhinovirus, n = 3; metapneumovirus, n = 1; adenovirus, n = 1) admitted until January 2019. Including the present case, four of 7 (57%) showed false-positive RIAT results due to human common cold coronaviruses infection. Two of the 4 patients showed initial negative to subsequent positive RIAT results, indicating seroconversion. RIAT was positive for IgG and IgM in viruses other than coronavirus in 2 (25.0%) and 1 (12.5%) patient. Because of high incidence of false positive RIAT results, cross antigenicity between human common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 can be considered. Results of RIAT should be interpreted in light of epidemics of human common cold coronaviruses infection. Prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection may be overestimated due to high incidence of false-positive RIAT results.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s)',\n",

These isoforms are distinguishable using the antibodies RD3 and RD4  respectively  and Gallyas (Gal) and Campbell-Switzer (CS) silver staining methods  respectively. Tau is also deposited in cerebral infarcts. To characterize the tau profile in these lesions  21 brains from autopsied patients with cerebral infarcts were analyzed using immunohistochemistry with RD3  RD4  and the anti-paired helical filament antibody AT8 and with Gal and CS staining; all of these techniques identify Alzheimer disease-type neurofibrillary tangles. Fluorescence labeling followed by silver staining in mirror-section pairs was also used to compare the staining patterns. Neurons in and around ischemic foci exhibited the 4R-tau epitope until 34 days postinfarction; argyrophilia with Gal staining persisted longer. The 4R-tau/Gal-positive neurons were negative for 3R-tau and AT8 epitopes and lacked fibrillary structures and argyrophilia by CS staining; they are  therefore  distinct from neurons with neurofibrillary tangles. Positivity for 4R tau/Gal and negativity for 3R tau/CS were also seen in astrocytes and microglia around infarcts. Although this staining profile is characteristic of degenerative processes with 4R-tau deposition  lack of AT8 immunoreactivity and of fibrillary structures in neurons  astrocytes  and microglia indicates that selective 4R-tau deposition represents a stage without tau phosphorylation or fibril formation in cerebral infarcts.',\n",

Up to date  there are limited algorithms available to automatically delineate these cerebral abnormalities partially due to their complex appearance in MR images. In this paper  we describe an automated multi-stage segmentation approach for labeling the WMH  CI  and LI using multi-modal MR images. We first automatically segment brain tissues (white matter  gray matter  and CSF) based on the T1-weighted image and then identify hyperintense voxels based on the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image.

Our results show that the automated segmentation of the WMH  CI  and LI is comparable with manual labeling in terms of spatial location  volume  and the number of lacunes. Additionally  the WMH volume is highly correlated with the visual grading score based on the Age-Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) protocol.

The absence of approved therapeutics to combat this disease threatens the health of all persons on earth and could cause catastrophic damage to society. New drugs are therefore urgently required to bring relief to people everywhere. In addition to repurposing existing drugs, natural products provide an interesting alternative due to their widespread use in all cultures of the world. In this study, alkaloids from Cryptolepis sanguinolenta have been investigated for their ability to inhibit two of the main proteins in SARS-CoV-2, the main protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, using in silico methods. Molecular docking was used to assess binding potential of the alkaloids to the viral proteins whereas molecular dynamics was used to evaluate stability of the binding event. The results of the study indicate that all 13 alkaloids bind strongly to the main protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with binding energies ranging from -6.7 to -10.6 kcal/mol. In particular, cryptomisrine, cryptospirolepine, cryptoquindoline, and biscryptolepine exhibited very strong inhibitory potential towards both proteins. Results from the molecular dynamics study revealed that a stable protein-ligand complex is formed upon binding. Alkaloids from Cryptolepis sanguinolenta therefore represent a promising class of compounds that could serve as lead compounds in the search for a cure for the corona virus disease.

No universal agreement  however  has been established regarding specific techniques for tourniquet applications. In fact  present data reflect a general consensus that tourniquet use and location other than above the ankles has no appreciable or recognizable effect on study outcome. A prospective study was performed on 20 consecutive patients referred for RNV with the clinical impression of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Each patient was studied initially with tourniquets above the knee and ankle  then with tourniquets above the ankle only  and finally without tourniquets. On the basis of standard criteria for DVT  8 out of 20 patients were positive for DVT when the study was performed with tourniquets only above the ankle. Four of the eight positive studies became negative  however  when additional tourniquets were placed above the knees (20% false-positive rate).

       "  {'feature': \"Involvement of the intracellular ion channel CLIC1 in microglia-mediated beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity.It is widely believed that the inflammatory events mediated by microglial activation contribute to several neurodegenerative processes. Alzheimer's disease  for example  is characterized by an accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in neuritic plaques that are infiltrated by reactive microglia and astrocytes. Although Abeta and its fragment 25-35 exert a direct toxic effect on neurons  they also activate microglia. Microglial activation is accompanied by morphological changes  cell proliferation  and release of various cytokines and growth factors. A number of scientific reports suggest that the increased proliferation of microglial cells is dependent on ionic membrane currents and in particular on chloride conductances. An unusual chloride ion channel known to be associated with macrophage activation is the chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1). Here we show that Abeta stimulation of neonatal rat microglia specifically leads to the increase in CLIC1 protein and to the functional expression of CLIC1 chloride conductance  both barely detectable on the plasma membrane of quiescent cells. CLIC1 protein expression in microglia increases after 24 hr of incubation with Abeta  simultaneously with the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We demonstrate that reducing CLIC1 chloride conductance by a specific blocker [IAA-94 (R(+)-[(6 7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2 3-dihydro-2-methyl-1-oxo-1H-inden-5yl)-oxy] acetic acid)] prevents neuronal apoptosis in neurons cocultured with Abeta-treated microglia. Furthermore  we show that small interfering RNAs used to knock down CLIC1 expression prevent TNF-alpha release induced by Abeta stimulation. These results provide a direct link between Abeta-induced microglial activation and CLIC1 functional expression.\",\n",

Clinical testing in HIV patients included the HIV dementia scale (HDS)  Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the grooved pegboard test. Comparing controls with HIV positive patients with cognitive dysfunction (n = 28) VBM showed gray matter decrease in the anterior cingulate and temporal cortices along with white matter reduction in the midbrain region. These changes were more prominent with increasing cognitive decline  when assigning HIV patients to three cognitive groups (not impaired  mildly impaired  overtly impaired) based on performance in the HIV dementia scale. Regression analysis including all HIV positive patients with available data revealed that prefrontal gray matter atrophy in HIV was associated with longer disease duration (n = 48)  while motor dysfunction (n = 48) was associated with basal ganglia gray matter atrophy. Lower CD4 cell count (n = 47) correlated with decrease of occipital gray matter. Our results provide evidence for atrophy of nigro-striatal and fronto-striatal circuits in HIV.

This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Tunisian women's mental health and gender-based violence. An online survey was conducted, using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS). We chose a female-exclusive social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. A total of 751 participants originating from all the Tunisian regions completed the questionnaire. More than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms, as per the DASS-21. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were allegedly abused during lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Around 40% of women reported problematic social media use. Violence against women also reportedly increased significantly during the lockdown (from 4.4 to 14.8%; p < 0.001).

This accumulation induces progressive degeneration of the nervous system. NPC shows some intriguing similarities with Alzheimer disease (AD)  including neurofibrillary tangles  but patients with NPC generally lack amyloid-ﾎｲ (Aﾎｲ) plaques. Lipids affect ﾎｳ-secretase-dependent amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism that generates Aﾎｲ in vitro  but this has been difficult to prove in vivo. Our aim was to assess the effect of altered lipid constituents in neuronal membranes on amyloidogenic APP processing in humans. METHODS: We examined Aﾎｲ in CSF from patients with NPC (n = 38) and controls (n = 14). CSF was analyzed for Aﾎｲ(38)  Aﾎｲ(40)  Aﾎｲ(42)  ﾎｱ-cleaved soluble APP  ﾎｲ-cleaved soluble APP  total-tau  and phospho-tau. RESULTS: Aﾎｲ release was markedly increased in NPC  with a shift toward the Aﾎｲ(42) isoform. Levels of ﾎｱ- and ﾎｲ-cleaved soluble APP were similar in patients and controls. Patients with NPC had increased total-tau. Patients on treatment with miglustat (n = 18)  a glucosylceramide synthase blocker  had lower Aﾎｲ(42) and total-tau than untreated patients. CONCLUSION: Increased CSF levels of Aﾎｲ(38)  Aﾎｲ(40)  and Aﾎｲ(42) and unaltered levels of ﾎｲ-cleaved soluble APP are consistent with increased ﾎｳ-secretase-dependent Aﾎｲ release in the brains of patients with NPC.

This report presents the synthesis and biological evaluation of (64)Cu-labeled 2-(diphenylphosphoryl)ethyldiphenylphosphonium (TPEP) cations as novel PET radiotracers for tumor imaging. Biodistribution studies were performed using the athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG human glioma xenografts to explore the impact of linkers  bifunctional chelators (BFCs)  and chelates on biodistribution characteristics of the (64)Cu-labeled TPEP cations. Metabolism studies were carried out using normal athymic nude mice to determine the metabolic stability of four (64)Cu radiotracers. It was found that most (64)Cu radiotracers described in this study have significant advantages over (99m)Tc-Sestamibi for their high tumor/heart and tumor/muscle ratios. Both BFCs and linkers have significant impact on biological properties of (64)Cu-labeled TPEP cations. For example  (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) has much lower liver uptake and better tumor/liver ratios than (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPP)  suggesting that TPEP is a better mitochondrion-targeting molecule than TPP. Replacing DO3A with DO2A results in (64)Cu(DO2A-xy-TPEP) (+)  which has a lower tumor uptake than (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP). Substitution of DO3A with NOTA-Bn leads to a significant decrease in tumor uptake for (64)Cu(NOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP). The use of DOTA-Bn to replace DO3A has little impact on the tumor uptake  but the tumor/liver ratio of (64)Cu(DOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP) (-) is not as good as that of (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP)  probably due to the aromatic benzene ring in DOTA-Bn. Addition of an extra acetamido group in (64)Cu(DOTA-xy-TPEP) results in a lower liver uptake  but tumor/liver ratios of (64)Cu(DOTA-xy-TPEP) and (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) are comparable due to a faster tumor washout of (64)Cu(DOTA-xy-TPEP). Substitution of xylene with the PEG 2 linker also leads to a significant reduction in both tumor and liver uptake. MicroPET imaging studies on (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) in athymic nude mice bearing U87MG glioma xenografts showed that the tumor was clearly visualized as early as 1 h postinjection with very high T/B contrast. There was very little metabolite (<2%) detectable in the urine and feces samples for (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP)  (64)Cu(DOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP)(-)  and (64)Cu(NOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP).

The aim of this observational study was to present a cohort of patients with high FDG uptake in BAT who underwent a second scan after receiving a low dose of propranolol  to determine whether the use of this premedication could improve the diagnostic confidence of FDG-PET scans by inhibition FDG uptake in BAT  and also whether administration of this drug affects tracer uptake in tumors. METHODS: Twenty-six cancer patients  presenting with increased BAT FDG uptake  were selected prospectively. On a different day  patients were given propranolol 20 mg orally 60 minutes prior to FDG administration 185-277.5 MBq (5-7.5 mCi) and were scanned again. Basal and postpropranolol BAT SUVmax  and tumor SUVmax (when present) were measured. RESULTS: Mean basal BAT SUVmax was 5.52+/-2.3. Mean postpropranolol SUVmax was 1.39+/-0.42 (P<0.0001).

The CT and TT genotypes of PLAU_1 were also associated with significant age-dependent elevation of plasma Abeta42 in 24 extended LOAD families (P=0.0006). In knockout mice lacking the PLAU gene  plasma--but not brain--Abeta42 as well as Abeta40 was significantly elevated  also in an age-dependent manner. The PLAU_1 associations were independent of the associations we found among plasma Abeta42  LOAD and variants in the IDE or VR22 region. These results provide strong evidence that PLAU or a nearby gene is involved in the development of LOAD. PLAU_1 is a plausible pathogenic mutation that could act by increasing Abeta42  but additional biological experiments are required to show this definitively.\",\n",

Markers of lipoperoxidation and deficits in serum antioxidants could have a predictive value for identifying subjects at risk of dementia and to predict cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: Search for relationships between the levels of some oxidative stress biomarkers and cognitive function decline that would help predict this decline. METHODS: The study solicited and included 97 patients aged 63 to 93 years with various suspected neurodegenerative diseases (35 with AD). They were followed up at six-month intervals over two years (2010-2012). The study: i) assessed the blood levels of glutathione peroxidase  glutathione  and malondialdehyde; ii) performed the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE)  the Clock Drawing test  the free/cued recall task with 16-item lists  the cue percentage; and the Trail Making Test; and iii) acquired brain magnetic resonance imaging or tomodensitometry. The primary outcome measure was the MMSE score. RESULTS: The MMSE score was correlated with the score of each neuropsychological test  the age at baseline  and the glutathione level. On average  the decline in the MMSE score was 1.63 points per six months. A 100 International Unit increase in glutathione peroxidase was associated with an average loss of 1.19 MMSE points per six months (p = 0.002). A 100 ﾎｼmol/L increase in glutathione was associated with an average loss of 1.80 MMSE points per six months (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress biomarkers  especially glutathione peroxidase and glutathione  may predict the course of cognitive decline in patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders.\",\n",

However  the concrete neural mechanisms underlying this process are still unknown. In this study  we investigated these mechanisms in detail. Eighteen healthy human participants were presented with multiple items consisting of faces or buildings. They either had to maintain two or four items from one category (low- and high-memory-load condition)  or two from one category and suppress (filter out) two items from the other category (distraction condition). Striatal activity was increased in the distraction as compared with the high-load condition. Activity in category-specific regions in the inferior temporal cortex [fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA)] was reduced when items from the other category needed to be selectively maintained. Furthermore  functional connectivity analysis showed significant reduction of striatal-PPA correlations during selective maintenance of faces. However  striatal-FFA connectivity was not reduced during maintenance of buildings vs. faces  possibly because face stimuli are more salient. Taken together  our results suggest that the ventral striatum supports selective WM maintenance by reduced gating of task-irrelevant activity via attenuating functional connectivity without increasing task-relevant activity correspondingly.',\n",

Mechanisms for pathway activation include loss of tumor suppressor PTEN function  amplification or mutation of PI3K  amplification or mutation of Akt  activation of growth factor receptors  and exposure to carcinogens. Once activated  signaling through Akt can be propagated to a diverse array of substrates  including mTOR  a key regulator of protein translation.

Relevant articles that reported the incidence, demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of cancer patients infected by COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Among 559 articles that were further screened, 14 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The incidence of cancer across various studies ranged from 0.5% to 2.43%. Males were more than females, and the mean age affected was 63.1-66 years. Lung cancer was the most common subtype (25%-58.3%). Cancer patients, as reported, had a higher risk of progressing to severe events (hazard ratio:3.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.65-7.69; P < 0.0001). Nearly 39%-53.6% of patients who had a recent history of anticancer therapy developed severe events. Individuals with cancer feared the risk of complications. Cancer patients have worse outcomes from COVID-19, compared to the general population, providing a reason to pay more timely attention.

To test whether pathology initiating in the EC spreads through the brain along synaptically connected circuits  we have generated a transgenic mouse model that differentially expresses pathological human tau in the EC and we have examined the distribution of tau pathology at different timepoints. In relatively young mice (10-11 months old)  human tau was present in some cell bodies  but it was mostly observed in axons within the superficial layers of the medial and lateral EC  and at the terminal zones of the perforant pathway. In old mice (>22 months old)  intense human tau immunoreactivity was readily detected not only in neurons in the superficial layers of the EC  but also in the subiculum  a substantial number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons especially in CA1  and in dentate gyrus granule cells. Scattered immunoreactive neurons were also seen in the deeper layers of the EC and in perirhinal and secondary somatosensory cortex. Immunoreactivity with the conformation-specific tau antibody MC1 correlated with the accumulation of argyrophilic material seen in old  but not young mice. In old mice  axonal human tau immunoreactivity  especially at the endzones of the perforant pathway  was greatly reduced. Relocalization of tau from axons to somatodendritic compartments and propagation of tauopathy to regions outside of the EC correlated with mature tangle formation in neurons in the EC as revealed by thioflavin-S staining. Our data demonstrate propagation of pathology from the EC and support a trans-synaptic mechanism of spread along anatomically connected networks  between connected and vulnerable neurons.

A 13 year old girl presented with a 10 month history of progressive non-bilious vomiting unresponsive to acid suppression or prokinetics. In the 2 months prior to her consultation she experienced a 15 lb weight loss. Bloodwork done on several occasions showed a normal CBC, ESR, CRP and albumin. Family history was remarkable for early onset peptic ulcer disease in her father and ulcerative colitis in her mother. An ultrasound showed a thick walled irregular pylorus and evidence of gastric outlet obstruction and an upper GI series showed irregularity and deformity of the first portion of the duodenum with severely delayed gastric emptying. Gastroscopy showed erythema and erosions in the distal esophagus and a dilated stomach with mucosal erythema and edema. The pylorus was pinpoint and a 5.2mm endoscope would not pass, however ulcerations were seen in the pyloric channel. Gastric biopsies showed evidence of moderate chronic active gastritis with granulomata. The patient placed on TPN and a liquid diet and a repeat gastroscopy and a colonoscopy were subsequently performed. The gastroscopy was completed successfully and showed ulceration and inflammation of D1 with a normal D2 and D3. There was moderate patchy colitis on colonoscopy. Testing for chronic granulomatous disease was negative. The patient was treated with IV steroids and TPN with a partial response, however she was unable to progress to a regular diet.

This dynamic process occurs in parallel with or as an alternative to physiologic folding  generating toxic protein aggregates that are deposited and accumulated in various organs and tissues. These proteinaceous deposits typically represent bundles of ﾎｲ-sheet-enriched fibrillar species known as the amyloid fibrils that are responsible for serious pathological conditions  including but not limited to neurodegenerative diseases  grouped under the term amyloidoses. The proteins that might adopt this fibrillar conformation are some globular proteins and natively unfolded (or intrinsically disordered) proteins. Our work shows that intrinsically disordered and intrinsically ordered proteins can be reliably identified  discriminated  and differentiated by analyzing their polarity profiles generated using a computational tool known as the polarity index method (Polanco & Samaniego  2009; Polanco et al.  2012; 2013; 2013a; 2014; 2014a; 2014b; 2014c; 2014d).

We used weekly mean numbers of deaths of 2016-2019 to estimate expected weekly numbers for 2020. We estimated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: During the first wave observed numbers of deaths were higher than expected for age groups 60-69, 80-89, and 90+. The age group 70-79 years did not show excess mortality. The net excess number of deaths for weeks 10-23 was +8,071. The overall SMR was 1*03 (95%CI 1*03-1*04). The largest increase occurred among people aged 80-89 and 90+ (SMR=1*08 and SMR=1*09).

       "  {'feature': 'Impact of school closures for COVID-19 on the US health-care workforce and net mortality: a modelling studyBACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. METHODS: For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. FINDINGS: Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3.1 million individuals across 1.3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28.8% (95% CI 28.5-29.1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3-12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15.0% (14.8-15.2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15.0% case reduction from school closings and 2.0% baseline mortality rate, a 15.0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2.00% to 2.35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15.0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. INTERPRETATION: School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

       "  {'feature': 'Problems Encountered by Nurses Due to the Use of Personal Protective Equipment During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Results of a SurveyThe importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) for nurses in the global fight against the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic cannot be overstated. PPE must be available, safe, and effective. There is increasing evidence that the use of PPE can cause physical health problems. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to further examine PPE-related physical problems experienced by nurses as well as the role of wear time on these problems. METHODS: Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, a survey was conducted among nurses working for state or university hospitals across Turkey who actively cared for patients with COVID-19. Survey questions included demographic variables, type of PPE used, physical problems experienced, and length of time PPE was worn (4 hours or less, or more than 4 hours). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven (307) nurses completed the survey. The most commonly reported problems were sweating when wearing a surgical (50.9%) or N95 (64.2%) mask, dry hands from wearing gloves (73.9%), perspiration when wearing overalls/gowns (84.1%), and vision problems when wearing goggles/face shields (47.9%). Logistic regression analysis indicated a signifcant relationship between > 4 hours length of use and the occurrence of the following: redness of the cheeks, dry mouth, redness of the nose bridge, and redness of the ears for N95 masks; dryness of the mouth when wearing surgical masks; skin dryness, sweating, and redness from wearing gloves; headaches from wearing goggles/face shields; and sweating when wearing overalls or a gown (P < .05 for all variables). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that physical problems related to the use of PPE are common and increase when PPE is worn for more than 4 hours. The availability, safety, and effectiveness of PPE are crucial to help protect nurses. Studies to examine PPE quality, characteristics, efficacy, and optimal use are necessary to maintain the healthy workforce needed to care for patients during this pandemic.',\n",

These include inhibitors of Abeta-generating proteases for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Testing the amyloid hypothesis in vivo requires molecules that are capable of entering the CNS and that produce a substantial reduction in brain Abeta levels. Plaque-developing APP transgenic mice are currently widely used as an in vivo model of choice as these animals produce readily measurable amounts of human Abeta. They are very useful in the testing of a variety of amyloid-lowering approaches but their use for compound screening is often limited by their cost. Transgenic animals also require extensive  time-consuming breeding programs and can show high inter-animal differences in the expression level of the transgene. Hence  we considered it important to develop and characterize a new and simple non-transgenic animal model for testing Abeta modulation. For this purpose  Wild-type adult Sprague Dawley rats were treated with DAPT  a functional gamma-secretase inhibitor  and the Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in brain-tissue and body fluids were assessed. We showed that DAPT  given orally  significantly lowered Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptide levels in brain extract  CSF  and the plasma dose- and time-dependently. We can conclude that our data establish the usefulness of the wild-type rat model for testing small-molecule inhibitors of Abeta production.\",\n",

Nonetheless  as a standard formulation  doxorubicin has not been used clinically  due to poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore  doxorubicin is known to induce tumor resistance genes. To address both of these issues  the authors investigated the use of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx; Essex Pharma  Munich  Germany) alone (Trial 1) and in combination with tamoxifen (Trial 2) in two sequentially performed nonrandomized prospective Phase II trials involving patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. METHODS: Twenty patients were included in each trial. Progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and toxicity were the primary endpoints. Expression of the tumor resistance proteins multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1) and multiple resistance protein (MRP) was evaluated by immunohistochemical methods and by sestamibi-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). RESULTS: The overall response rate (including cases of disease stabilization) was 40% in both Trial 1 and Trial 2. PFS-6 was 15%  and the median time to disease progression was 17 weeks. It is noteworthy that 40% of patients with Grade III tumors had long-term responses  which lasted for up to 3 years. There was no significant difference between Trial 1 and Trial 2 in terms of efficacy. Both regimens were well tolerated  with the main side effect being palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia. The authors found no correlation between clinical response and expression of tumor resistance genes or between clinical response and SPECT data. CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin administered alone or in combination with tamoxifen is safe and moderately effective in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. None of the putative predictors for response that were evaluated proved to be significant in this setting',\n",

Racemization of Ser and Asp in A beta is a typical age-dependent modification in AD. We have shown recently that A beta1-40 racemized at Ser(26) ([D-Ser(26)]A beta 1-40) is soluble and non-toxic to neuronal cells  but is easily converted by brain proteases to truncated toxic fragments  [D-Ser(26)]A beta 25-35/40. Furthermore  [D-Ser(26)]A beta1-40 in vivo  produced a drastic and synergistic neuronal loss by enhancing the excitotoxicity when co-injected into rat hippocampus with ibotenic acid  an excitatory amino acid  suggesting an in vivo conversion of non-toxic [D-Ser(26)]A beta1-40 to toxic fragments including [D-Ser(26)]A beta 25-35/40. In this study  we further investigated the mechanism behind the in vivo neuronal loss by [D-Ser(26)]A beta1-40 and ibotenic acid in rats  and also searched for the presence of [D-Ser(26)]A beta 25-35/40 antigens in AD brains. Quantitative analyses of the damaged area indicate clearly that non-toxic [D-Ser(26)]A beta 1-40 caused as much neurodegeneration as toxic [D-Ser(26)]A beta 25-35/40. MK-801  an NMDA receptor antagonist  completely inhibited the neurodegeneration. The immunohistochemical analyses using anti-[D-Ser(26)]A beta 25-35/40-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of [D-Ser(26)]A beta 25-35/40 antigens in senile plaques and in degenerating hippocampal CA1 neurons in AD brains  but not in age-matched control brains. These results strengthen our hypothesis that soluble [D-Ser(26)]A beta1-40  possibly produced during aging  is released from plaques and converted by proteolysis to toxic [D-Ser(26)]A beta 25-35/40  which damage hippocampal CA1 neurons by enhancing excitotoxicity in AD. This may account for the lag between A beta deposition and neurodegeneration in AD.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': \"The expression of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) is associated with aging-related cell death in the cortex but not in the hippocampus in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has suggested that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated neuronal loss may occur via the caspase-independent route of programmed cell death (PCD) in addition to caspase-dependent mechanisms. However  the brain region specificity of caspase-independent PCD in AD-associated neurodegeneration is unknown. We therefore used the transgenic CRND8 (TgCRND8) AD mouse model to explore whether the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF)  a key mediator of caspase-independent PCD  contributes to cell loss in selected brain regions in the course of aging. RESULTS: Increased expression of truncated AIF (tAIF)  which is directly responsible for cell death induction  was observed at both 4- and 6-months of age in the cortex. Concomitant with the up-regulation of tAIF was an increase in the nuclear translocation of this protein. Heightened tAIF expression or translocation was not observed in the hippocampus or cerebellum  which were used as AD-vulnerable and relatively AD-spared regions  respectively. The cortical alterations in tAIF levels were accompanied by increased Bax expression and mitochondrial translocation. This effect was preceded by a significant reduction in ATP content and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production  detectable at 2ﾂ\\uf8f0months of age despite negligible amounts of amyloid-beta peptides (Aﾎｲ). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together  these data suggest that AIF is likely to play a region-specific role in AD-related caspase-independent PCD  which is consistent with aging-associated mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress.\",\n",

A real-time beam monitoring system based on megavoltage computed tomography scanning has been developed to establish a verification method for the rotational conformation technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Exit beam through the patient is extracted by the same detector unit as used for megavoltage scanning during the actual treatment. Beam edge is defined as the 50% level of the maximum dose of the detector array. Megavoltage computed tomography is done after patient setup and just prior to the actual irradiation. Detected beam pathways are overlaid on this image approximately every 1 s. Therapists can monitor correlation between the target and actual beam pathways on a real-time computer display. RESULTS: The accuracy of field edge detection has been proven to be less than 2 mm from various measurements. Real-time monitoring is more useful in rotational conformation than in static multiport irradiation due to dynamic movement of the collimator. Field errors were identified in two of 54 sessions using this method.

However  up to the present  no validated extracerebral diagnostic markers for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) are available. The clinical diagnosis of probable AD is made with around 90% accuracy using modern clinical  neuropsychological and imaging methods. A biochemical marker that would support the clinical diagnosis and distinguish AD from other causes of dementia would therefore be of great value as a screening test. A total of 126 samples were obtained from subjects with AD  and age-sex-matched controls. Additionally  51 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were used as an example of another neurodegenerative disorder. We analyzed saliva and plasma levels of ﾎｲ amyloid (Aﾎｲ) using a highly sensitive ELISA kit. RESULTS: We found a small but statistically significant increase in saliva Aﾎｲ42 levels in mild AD patients. In addition  there were not differences in saliva concentration of Aﾎｲ42 between patients with PD and healthy controls. Saliva Aﾎｲ40 expression was unchanged within all the studied sample. The association between saliva Aﾎｲ42 levels and AD was independent of established risk factors  including age or Apo E  but was dependent on sex and functional capacity. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that saliva Aﾎｲ42 levels could be considered a potential peripheral marker of AD and help discrimination from other types of neurodegenerative disorders.

Intermediate filaments type IV include three neurofilament proteins (light  medium and heavy molecular weight neurofilament subunits) and ﾎｱ-internexin. The phosphorylation of intermediate filament proteins contributes to axonal growth  and is regulated by protein kinase A. Here we describe a family with a novel late-onset neurodegenerative disorder presenting with dementia and/or parkinsonism in 12 affected individuals. The disorder is characterized by a unique neuropathological phenotype displaying abundant neuronal inclusions by haematoxylin and eosin staining throughout the brain with immunoreactivity for intermediate filaments. Combining linkage analysis  exome sequencing and proteomics analysis  we identified a heterozygous c.149T>G (p.Leu50Arg) missense mutation in the gene encoding the protein kinase A type I-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR1B). The pathogenicity of the mutation is supported by segregation in the family  absence in variant databases  and the specific accumulation of PRKAR1B in the inclusions in our cases associated with a specific biochemical pattern of PRKAR1B. Screening of PRKAR1B in 138 patients with Parkinson's disease and 56 patients with frontotemporal dementia did not identify additional novel pathogenic mutations. Our findings link a pathogenic PRKAR1B mutation to a novel hereditary neurodegenerative disorder and suggest an altered protein kinase A function through a reduced binding of the regulatory subunit to the A-kinase anchoring protein and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A  which might result in subcellular dislocalization of the catalytic subunit and hyperphosphorylation of intermediate filaments.\",\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study; all subjects gave written informed consent. Twenty patients with mild cognitive impairment (12 men  eight women; mean age  75.0 years +/- 7.6 [standard deviation]) and 20 elderly control subjects (nine men  11 women; mean age  71.2 years +/- 4.5) underwent functional MR imaging at 4 T during a novel-versus-familiar face-name encoding-retrieval task. The magnitude of blood oxygen level-dependent brain responses across the entire brain were compared within and between subjects with mild cognitive impairment and control subjects by using a voxelwise random-effects model. A one-sample t test was used for within-group analysis; an analysis-of-covariance model (with age as a covariate) was used for between-group analysis. RESULTS: Brain regions activated by the task (prefrontal  medial temporal  and parietal regions) during encoding were similar to those activated during retrieval  with larger areas activated during retrieval. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment showed decreased magnitude of activation in bilateral frontal cortex regions (during encoding and retrieval)  the left hippocampus (during retrieval)  and the left cerebellum (during encoding) compared with magnitude of activation in control subjects (P < .001). Patients with mild cognitive impairment showed increased activation in the posterior frontal lobes (during retrieval) (P < .001). Lower hippocampal activation during retrieval was the most significant correlate of clinical severity of memory loss in mild cognitive impairment (P < .001). CONCLUSION: A difference exists in the response of brain regions underlying encoding and retrieval in mild cognitive impairment. Memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment may be linked to functional alterations in several specific brain regions both inside and outside the medial temporal lobe.',\n",

Measures of severity of dementia in AD as well as delayed episodic memory performance in mild cognitive impairment significantly correlated with bihemispheric cerebral glucose hypometabolism. We therefore hypothesized that the CERAD cognitive battery may represent cerebral dysfunction of both hemispheres in patients with AD. In 32 patients with AD  cerebral glucose metabolism was investigated using positron-emission-tomography with 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG PET) and associated with the test scores of the CERAD cognitive battery by statistical parametric mapping. Episodic memory scores significantly correlated with temporopari etal glucose metabolism of both hemispheres while delayed episodic memory significantly was correlated with the right frontotemporal cortices. Verbal fluency and naming scores significantly correlated with glucose metabolism in left temporoparietal and right frontal cortices  whereas constructional praxis predominantly correlated significantly with the bilateral precuneus. In conclusion  the results of our study demonstrate that not only memory function but also functions of language and constructional praxis in AD are associated with glucose metabolism as revealed by FDG PET in subsets of uni- and bilateral brain areas.

FINDINGS: A total of 604,258 patients with history of ischemic stroke were identified, of which 891 patients (study cohort) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A control cohort with 32,136 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after January 20th 2020 without a history of ischemic stroke were identified. A comparison between study cohort and control cohort showed patients with prior history of stroke (study cohort) were older (69.5 vs 47.8; p<0.0001) and had more comorbidities contributing to worse clinical outcomes. After propensity matching for demographic variables and comorbidities, only rate of hospitalization (287 vs 231; p=0.0035) and need for critical care services (85 vs 55; p=0.0082) remained statistically significant while intubation (51 vs 43; p=0.39) and death (119 vs 115; p=0.77) showed trends towards worse outcomes but were not statistically significant.

METHODS: Cranial MRI and other medical examinations were performed on non-demented elderly subjects who resided in one rural community. A total of 254 subjects aged from 60 to 91 years of age  with a mean age of 73.9 (SD 6.8) were examined. The mini mental state examination (MMSE) was used to identify cognitive impairment. White matter lesions and cerebral atrophy on MR images were measured quantitatively. A multivariate analysis was also performed with the existence of cognitive impairment as the dependent variable  and the MRI findings and clinical observations were used as the independent variables. RESULTS: Cognitive impairment was present in 46 subjects (18.1%). They were older  had a lower educational level  and more frequent hypertension compared with those without cognitive impairment. The packed cell volume was lower in the impaired group. In addition  their MRI findings showed significantly larger quantities of white matter lesions and cerebral atrophy  as well as more infarcts. A logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant relation among such factors as white matter lesions (odds ratio (OR) 1.575  95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.123-2.208)  cerebral atrophy (OR 0.761  95%CI 0.587-0.987)  and lower education (OR 0.682  95%CI 0.544-0.855) for subjects with a cognitive impairment.

Aim of this study was to evaluate routine hematology parameters in time after admission. Method(s): Data from routine blood analyses from confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the University Hospital of Leuven in Belgium were collected. COVID-19 patients (n = 197) were assigned to three groups: a 'non-ICU' group, a 'ICU' group and a 'deceased' group. A control group of 60 Influenza A (non-COVID-19) patients was also included. The parameters evaluated were platelet count (PLT, 109/L), hemoglobin concentration (Hb, g/dL), leukocyte count (LEU, 109/L), neutrophil count (NEU, %), eosinophil count (EO, %), lymphocyte count (LYM, %) and monocyte count (MONO, %). Result(s): Deceased COVID-19 patients had significant lower platelet count, higher leukocyte/neutrophil count, and lower eosinophil/lymphocyte/monocyte count compared to recovered patients. Especially lymphocyte count showed important differences; they were significantly lower between day 9 and 12 after admission making this time window important in predicting clinical worsening of a patient. Conclusion(s): Patients with COVID-19 with poor outcome showed significant differences in results of routine hematological parameters compared with patients that recovered. Especially lymphocyte count can be helpful in the prediction of a patients outcome.Copyright Â© Belgian Society of Internal Medicine and Royal Belgian Society of Laboratory Medicine (2020).\",\n",

Therefore  STN DBS seems to be well indicated for patients suffering from medication-induced psychotic symptoms. However  there are few available data dealing with the effect of STN DBS in this kind of patient. The authors studied the effect of STN DBS in patients with PD and severe medication-induced hallucinations or delusions. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 10 patients who suffered from severe medication-induced hallucinations or delusions and underwent bilateral STN DBS. Patients whose preoperative thought disorder score (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part I  item 2) was 3 or more were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent cognitive function examination and brain perfusion SPECT preoperatively to exclude dementia with Lewy bodies. RESULTS: Subthalamic nucleus DBS yielded significant improvement of motor function in all patients. In 8 patients  psychotic symptoms completely disappeared with significant reduction of dopaminergic medication. In 2 patients  hallucinations and delusions deteriorated immediately after surgery despite complete withdrawal of antiparkinsonian medication. However  these psychotic symptoms completely disappeared after a few months with administration of antipsychotics  and no recurrence was observed afterward in either patient. CONCLUSIONS: Subthalamic nucleus DBS is a good treatment option for patients with PD who are suffering severe medication-induced hallucinations or delusion. However  vigilance is needed  because temporary deterioration of psychotic symptoms may occur after surgery.\",\n",

As states begin to lift these orders to reopen the economy, the risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 may be related to the public's voluntary adherence to public health recommendations. We conducted a nationally representative survey of 604 African Americans to generate a risk assessment based on African Americans' compliance with public health recommendations to frequently wash hands, maintain social distancing, avoid touching face, and wear a mask in public. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive study of African Americans and public health adherence specific to COVID-19. The percent of respondents reporting that they always comply with these recommendations was 72%, 67%, 55%, and 65%, respectively. Based on this threshold, African Americans' level of adherence with COVID-19 public health recommendations suggests they may be at high risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 during reopening, and there is an urgent need for targeted, culturally responsive public health messaging that is accessible to communities of color to help address racial disparities in COVID-19 risk.

Individuals with high levels of cognitive function after midlife may have less exposure to these stroke risk factors or may be less susceptible to their effects on cognition. METHODS: The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)* is a population-based  longitudinal cohort study of 5 888 people age 65 years and older. Participants (n = 4 129) who were free of dementia  stroke  or TIA at the time of baseline cranial MRI were selected for analysis. High cognitive function at baseline was defined by performance at or above midlife norms on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS). RESULTS: The odds of having high cognitive function at baseline decreased by quartile of stroke risk (highest vs lowest risk quartile  adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.68; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88; p for trend = 0.005). Stroke risk was a predictor of decline on the 3MS in those with typical levels of cognitive function at baseline  even in the absence of incident stroke or TIA (highest vs lowest risk quartile for 3MS decline  adjusted OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.42 to 3.13; p for trend < 0.001).

Distinct roles for parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices in place recognition.A key component of spatial navigation is the ability to use visual information to ascertain where one is located and how one is oriented in the world. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates of this phenomenon in humans. Subjects were scanned while retrieving different kinds of topographical and nontopographical information in response to visual scenes. In the three critical conditions  they viewed images of a familiar college campus  and reported either the location of the place depicted in the image (location task)  the compass direction that the camera was facing when the image was taken (orientation task)  or whether the location was on campus or not (familiarity task). Our analyses focused on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC)/parietal-occipital sulcus region and the parahippocampal place area (PPA)  which previous studies indicate play a critical role in place recognition. RSC activity depended on the type of information retrieved  with the strongest response in the location task. In contrast  PPA activity did not depend on the retrieval task. Additional analyses revealed a strong effect of familiarity in RSC but not in the PPA  with the former region responding much more strongly to images of the familiar campus than to images of an unfamiliar campus. These results suggest that the PPA and RSC play distinct but complementary roles in place recognition.

All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans.

Despite its frequent occurrence  current knowledge of MPE remains limited and controversy surrounds almost every aspect in its diagnosis and management. A lack of robust data has led to significant practice variations worldwide  inefficiencies in healthcare provision  and threats to patient safety. Recent studies have highlighted evolving concepts in MPE care that challenge traditional beliefs. Advancing laboratory techniques have improved the diagnostic yield from pleural fluid cytology  minimizing the need for invasive tissue biopsies  even in many cases of mesothelioma. Imaging-guided biopsy is comparable to thoracoscopy in suitable patients  if cytological examination was noncontributory. Cumulating evidence for the benefits of indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) has led some centers to adopt this approach as first-line definitive management for MPE over conventional talc pleurodesis. The optimal technique of talc pleurodesis is still debated despite its use for many decades. Strategies combining pleurodesis and IPC are being studied.

We report a patient with paradoxical embolism that developed after gastrointestinal endoscopy (GE). Objective: To illustrate the possible mechanism of paradoxical embolism related to GE. Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: A left-handed 66-year-old man with Crohn's disease took warfarin for venous thrombus in the Superior Vena Cava. However, warfarin was discontinued due to unstable coagulation state. Onemonth later, he underwent follow-up GE for recurrent duodenal ulcer. He noticed left hand numbness and difficulty initiating speech after a 3-hour nap following GE. Results: Vital signs were normal and he had no physical abnormalities. Neurological findings showed disorientation, motor aphasia, and hypesthesia in the left hand. Laboratory tests showed mild anemia, hypoalbuminemia and elevated D-dimer levels (2.7ﾎｼg/mL). Brain MRI exhibited an acute cerebral infarction in the right temporal and parietal lobes. Whole body contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated SVC occlusion by thrombus. Contrast enhanced transesophageal echocardiography revealed persistent patent foramen ovale (PFO).

One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors.

After induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure and heart rate of the patients decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Most of the patients (94.44%) were in excellent or good conditions for tracheal intubation, and the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation was 100%. Five patients died within 3 weeks following the intubation. Tracheotomy was performed in one patient. Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation. A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality. Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety. The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.\",\n",

Quantitative EEG is related to and predictive of cognitive status in PD. In this cross-sectional study  the relationship of cognitive domains and EEG slowing in PD patients without dementia is investigated. METHODS: A total of 48 patients with idiopathic PD were neuropsychologically tested. Cognitive domain scores were calculated combining Z-scores of test variables. Slowing of EEG was measured with median EEG frequency. Linear regression was used for correlational analyses and to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: EEG median frequency was significantly correlated to cognitive performance in most domains (episodic long-term memory  rho = 0.54; overall cognitive score  rho = 0.47; fluency  rho = 0.39; attention  rho = 0.37; executive function  rho = 0.34)  but not to visuospatial functions and working memory. CONCLUSION: Global EEG slowing is a marker for overall cognitive impairment in PD and correlates with impairment in the domains attention  executive function  verbal fluency  and episodic long-term memory  but not with working memory and visuospatial functions. These disparate effects warrant further investigations.\",\n",

Consequently  regulating APP expression is one approach to block disease progression. To this end  APP can be targeted at the levels of transcription  translation  and protein stability. Little is currently known about the translation of APP mRNA. Here  we report that endogenous APP mRNA is translated in neural cell lines via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5'-untranslated leader. The functional unit of the APP IRES is located within the 5' 50 nucleotides of the 5'-leader. In addition  we found that the APP IRES is positively regulated by two conditions correlated with AD  increased intracellular iron concentration and ischemia. Interestingly  the enhancement of APP IRES activity is dependent upon de novo transcription. Taken together  our data suggest that internal initiation of translation of the APP mRNA is an important mode for synthesis of APP  a mechanism which is regulated by conditions that also contribute to AD.\",\n",

We observed POS in 5 of 20 cases of severe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, which demonstrated persistently elevated shunt fraction even after liberation from mechanical ventilation. POS was first observed during physiotherapy sessions; median oxygen desaturation was 8% (range: 8-12%). Affected individuals were older (median 64 vs 53 years old, p = 0.05) and had lower body mass index (median 24.7 vs 27.6 kg/m (Radermacher et al., 2017), p = 0.03) compared to those without POS. While POS caused alarm and reduced tolerance to therapy, this phenomenon resolved over a median of 17 days with improvement of parenchymal disease. The mechanisms of POS are likely due to gravitational redistribution of pulmonary blood flow resulting in increased basal physiological shunting and upper zone dead space ventilation due to the predominantly basal distribution of consolidative change and reported vasculoplegia and microthrombi in severe COVID-19 disease.

Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation. A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Presentation of technique: The materials and assembly process of the novel \"Corona Curtain\" are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities. Results: A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct. The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source. Conclusion: The new \"Corona Curtain\" was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units. Future validation studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the intubation tents by quantifying the pre-/post-intubation exposure through \"point-of-care\" SARS-CoV-2 testing once these resources are more widely available.

In the effort to contribute to the identification of the structural features for high-affinity ligands selective versus serotonin  dopamine and other CNS-related receptors  two general classes of (naphthalene)alkylamine compounds were prepared and explored  with the aim of addressing the affinities toward the two recognized σ receptor subtypes. The common template of these compounds was mainly an unsubstituted or methoxy-substituted naphthalene or tetralin nucleus  linked by an alkyl spacer to a substituted piperazine or piperidine ring. The design of new ligands was thought keeping in mind their possible application as PET diagnostic tools and fluorescence tools. High-affinity σ<sub>2</sub> receptor ligands were found among N-cyclohexylpiperazine derivatives  such as 1-cyclohexyl-4-[3-(5-methoxy-1 2 3 4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)propyl] piperazine (3) (PB 28)  when they were assayed in radioligand binding with [<sup>3</sup>H]-DTG in rat liver. Unfortunately  these ligands were all devoid of a significant selectivity relative to σ<sub>1</sub> receptor whose binding was assayed with (+)-[<sup>3</sup>H]-pentazocine in guinea pig brain. Nevertheless  compound 3 had previously shown to be 40-fold selective with a slightly different binding method in animals' tissues. Moreover  it demonstrated 46-fold and 59-fold σ<sub>2</sub> versus σ<sub>1</sub> receptor binding selectivity in MCF7 and MCF7 ADR tumor cell lines respectively. In the class of piperazines  also high-affinity σ<sub>1</sub> receptor ligands were found  possibly due to the presence of a double N-atom and an additional reverse mode of binding. Piperidine derivatives were investigated as high-affinity and selective σ<sub>1</sub> receptor ligands leading to some 3 3-dimethylpiperidines such as 3 3-dimethyl-1-[3-(6-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl) propyl]piperidine (69) which resulted to be highly selective relative to the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor.

Understanding Tau-MT and Tau-Tau interactions would help to establish Tau function in health and disease. For many years  literature reports on Tau-MT binding behavior and affinity have remained surprisingly contradictory (e.g.  10-fold variation in Tau-MT affinity). Tau-Tau interactions have also been investigated  but whether MTs might affect Tau filament formation is unknown. We have addressed these issues through binding assays and microscopy. We assessed Tau-MT interactions via cosedimentation and found that the measured affinity of Tau varies greatly  depending on the experimental design and the protein concentrations used. To investigate this dependence  we used fluorescence microscopy to examine Tau-MT binding. Strikingly  we found that Taxol-stabilized MTs promote Tau filament formation without characterized Tau-filament inducers. We propose that these novel Tau filaments account for the incongruence in Tau-MT affinity measurements. Moreover  electron microscopy reveals that these filaments appear similar to the heparin-induced Alzheimer's model. These observations suggest that the MT-induced Tau filaments provide a new model for Alzheimer's studies and that MTs might play a role in the formation of Alzheimer's-associated neurofibrillary tangles.\",\n",

Themes of (1) specialty discernment, (2) alterations to medical education, and (3) the residency application process were explored. RESULTS: A total of 238 medical students, 87% third- and fourth- years, responded to the survey. While 85% indicated that the pandemic had not deterred their specialty choice, they noted substantial impacts on education, including 82% reporting decreased exposure to urology. Nearly half of students reported changes to required rotations and 35% reported changes to urology-specific rotations at their home institutions. Students shared concerns about suspending in-person experiences, including the impact on letters of recommendation (68% \"very concerned) and program choice (73% \"very concerned\"). Looking to the possibility of virtual interactions, students identified the importance of small group and one-on-one communication with residents (83% \"very important\") and opportunities to learn about hospital facilities (72% \"very important\").

Molecular pathways enriched in the progranulin gene set included cell adhesion and cell motility pathways and pathways involved in growth and development. Secretion of cytokines and several chemokines linked to chemoattraction but not inflammation were also increased from progranulin-treated primary neurons. Therefore  whether progranulin is involved in recruitment of immune cells in the brain was investigated. Localized lentiviral expression of progranulin in C57BL/6 mice resulted in an increase of Iba1-positive microglia around the injection site. Moreover  progranulin alone was sufficient to promote migration of primary mouse microglia in vitro. Primary microglia and C4B8 cells demonstrated more endocytosis of amyloid ﾎｲ1-42 when treated with progranulin.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool specimens. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and disease remains to be established. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 COVID-19 patients, 24 influenza A (H1N1) patients, and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. RESULTS: Compared with HC, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces, and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts. Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89. Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers were selected to distinguish the two cohorts with an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: The gut microbial signature of patients with COVID-19 was different from that of H1N1 patients and HC.

This research sought to explore the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and air quality (PM2.5) with the daily new cases of COVID-19 in the top four regions of Spain (Castilla y Leon, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, and Madrid). To this end, the authors employ Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and robust panel regressions to quantify the overall co-movement between temperature, air quality, and daily cases of COVID-19 from 29 February to 17 July 2020. Overall empirical results show that temperature may not be a determinant to induce COVID-19 spread in Spain, while the rising temperature may reduce the virus transmission. However, the correlation and regression findings illustrate that air quality may speed up the transmission rate of COVID-19. Our findings are contrary to the earlier studies, which show a significant impact of temperature in raising the COVID-19 spread.

As CSF tau protein is increased after stroke  tau may also be implicated in the pathophysiology of vascular dementia  of which subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) is a putative subtype. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nature of tau protein in CSF and the involvement of total CSF tau and phosphorylated CSF tau (phosphotau) in various types of dementia. METHODS: Using ELISAs for total tau and tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (phosphotau)  the CSF concentrations of total tau and phosphotau were determined in patients with probable and possible AD (n=41 and 19  respectively)  FTD (n=18)  SAE (n=17)  and Parkinson's disease (PD; n=15) and in age matched controls (n=17). All the antibodies stained the lower molecular weight bands  whereas only the antibodies that recognise phosphorylated tau stained the higher molecular bands. RESULTS: Both CSF tau and CSF phosphotau were increased in probable AD compared with FTD (p<0.001)  SAE (p<0.001)  PD (p<0.001)  and controls (p<0.001).

However  there is a pressing need for the identification of new reliable disease biomarkers. The pathological mechanisms leading to accumulation of 14-3-3 protein in CSF are not fully understood  however neuronal loss followed by cell lysis is assumed to cause the increase in 14-3-3 levels  which also occurs in conditions such as brain ischemia. Here we investigated the relation between the levels of 14-3-3 protein  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and expression of the prion protein (PrP) in CSF of sporadic and familial CJD cases. Unexpectedly  we found normal levels of LDH activity in CJD cases with moderate levels of 14-3-3 protein. Increased LDH activity was only observed in a percentage of the CSF samples that also exhibited high 14-3-3 levels. Analysis of the PrP expression pattern in CSF revealed a reduction in PrP levels in all CJD cases  as well as marked changes in its glycosylation pattern. PrP present in CSF of CJD cases was sensitive to proteases. The alterations in PrP expression observed in CJD cases were not detected in other pathologies affecting the nervous system  including cases of dementia and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM/TSP). Time course analysis in several CJD patients revealed that 14-3-3 levels in CSF are dynamic and show a high degree of variability during the end stage of the disease. Post-mortem analysis of brain tissue also indicated that 14-3-3 protein is upregulated in neuronal cells  suggesting that its expression is modulated during the course of the disease.

Independent risk factors for in-hospital death for patients with ESKD were increased age, being on a ventilator, lymphopenia, blood urea nitrogen and serum ferritin. Black race was associated with a lower risk of death. Thus, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those with ESKD had a higher rate of in-hospital death compared to those without ESKD.

As part of a controlled  prospective study  13 E200K fCJD patients underwent comprehensive evaluations  with EEG and an extensive MRI protocol that included one of the most prion-disease sensitive sequences  diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The relationship between EEG abnormalities and the pattern of DWI hyperintensities was examined. EEG demonstrated the classical CJD finding of PSWC (periodic sharp wave complexes) in five patients (38%) while in eight patients (62%) the EEG showed only slow activity. Six patients showed the typical cortical changes on MRI  and in five of them (83%) concordance between the MRI and the EEG was found. Five patients had isolated basal ganglia involvement per MRI  and in two of them (40%) concordance between the MRI and the EEG laterality was found. In the remaining two patients MRI did not show any changes suggesting CJD and EEG showed focal slow activity. The EEG of our E200K fCJD patients appears similar to that of the largest prion disease patient group  sporadic CJD (sCJD). EEG abnormalities in E200K fCJD appear to correlate mainly with cortical pathology  as revealed by DWI  rather than basal ganglia pathology. The observation that PSWC abnormalities reflect cortical rather than basal ganglia pathology is significant with respect to theories of the origins of EEG abnormalities in prion disease.',\n",

The diagnostic accuracy of impedance plethysmography  125I-fibrinogen leg scanning and real-time B-mode ultrasonography has been extensively evaluated in patients with asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis. Impedance plethysmography has been evaluated in a number of studies and its sensitivity has been invariably found to be approximately 20% or less. These results seem to be due to the high prevalence in asymptomatic patients of distal  small and nonocclusive thrombi  unable to produce a critical obstruction of the venous flow. The accuracy of 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning has been assessed in a number of studies and found to be significantly different in the initial and more recent studies. This difference has been found to be due to the quality of the study design: the better the methodology  the lower the diagnostic accuracy of 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning. The association of impedance plethysmography and 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning do not result in an improvement of the results obtained by the single diagnostic method. Study methodology strongly influenced the results obtained with real-time B-mode ultrasonography with a reported sensitivity of approximately 50% in the studies performed adopting an appropriate methodology. In conclusion  noninvasive diagnostic methods are inaccurate in the diagnosis of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis. Thus  venography remains the only accurate diagnostic method for the diagnosis of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis.',\n",

METHODS: Patients had a thorough neurological examination  and neuropsychological evaluation. A 24-hour intraventricular ICP-measurement  infusion test  neurophysiological investigations and MRI study were performed  and a cortical biopsy was obtained. The ICP measurement defined the need for a shunt. All 51 patients were re-examined three and twelve months later. The final follow-up was accomplished five years postoperatively. FINDINGS: 25 of the patients needed a shunt operation. One year after a shunt placement 72% of these patients had a good recovery concerning activities of daily living  58% benefited in their urinary incontinence and 57% walked better. During the 5 years of follow-up 8 patients with shunt and 9 without shunt had died. Positive effect of shunting remained. Only one neuropsychological test  recognition of words test  distinguishes the patients with the need for a shunt. Simple mini mental examination test was not different in those who improved. In the postoperative follow-up patients with shunt showed no change in neuropsychological tests even if they were subjectively better. The infusion test was of no value in diagnosing NPH. The 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease did worse after one year than those without pathological changes  but the mortality was not increased. INTERPRETATION: Specific neuropsychological tests are of little value in diagnosing NPH. Mini-Mental status examination was neither of value in diagnosing NPH nor in prediction of the outcome. In this study the infusion test did not improve diagnostic accuracy of NPH  but shunt placement relieves urinary incontinence and walking disability in patients with increased ICP.

To date, only a few studies have reported the distribution of lung lesions by segment. This study aimed to evaluate the lobar and segmental distribution of COVID-19 pneumonia based on patients' chest CT scan. Methods: This was a retrospective study performed on 63 Iranian adult patients with a final diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients had undergone chest CT scan on admission. Demographic data and imaging profile, including segmental distribution, were evaluated. Moreover, a scoring scale was designed to assess the severity of ground-glass opacification (GGO). The relationship of GGO score with age, sex, and symptoms at presentation was investigated. Results: Among included patients, mean age of patients was 54.2 +/-14.9 (range: 26 - 81) years old and 60.3% were male. Overall, the right lower lobe (87.3%) and the left lower lobe (85.7%) were more frequently involved. Specifically, predominant involvement was seen in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe (82.5%). The most common findings were peripheral GGO and consolidation, which were observed in 92.1% and 42.9% of patients, respectively. According to the self-designed GGO scoring scale, about half of the patients presented with mild GGO on admission. GGO score was found to be equally distributed among different sex and age categories; however, the presence of dyspnea on admission was significantly associated with a higher GGO score (p= 0.022). Cavitation, reticulation, calcification, bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance and nodules were not identified in any of the cases. Conclusion: COVID-19 mainly affects the lower lobes of the lungs. GGO and consolidation in the lung periphery is the imaging hallmark in patients with COVID-19 infection. Absence of bronchiectasis, solitary nodules, cavitation, calcifications, tree-in-bud appearance, and reversed halo-sign indicates that these features are not common findings, at least in the earlier stages.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Distribution and natural history of stress fractures in U.S. Marine recruitsIn a prospective study of stress injuries of the lower extremities of U.S. Marine recruits  we derived a frequency distribution of stress fractures. The most frequently fractured bone was the tibia (73%)  while the single most common site was the posterior calcaneal tuberosity (21%). The natural history of stress fractures by scintigraphy and radiography has been outlined  showing the evolutionary changes on either study as a universal progression independent of injury site or type of stress. An identical spectrum of changes should be present within any group undergoing intense new exercise. The frequency distribution of stress fractures should be a function of differing forms and intensities of exercise  therefore  our figures should not be applied to other groups. We used the presence of a scintigraphic abnormality at a symptomatic site as the criterion for diagnosis of stress fracture. Since the distribution of skeletal radiotracer uptake is directly dependent on local metabolic activity  it is expected that a focal alteration in bone metabolism will result in a scintigram approaching 100% sensitivity for the abnormality (9). In the proper clinical setting  the specificity should approximate this figure; however  a focal  nonstress-related bone abnormality which has not manifested any radiographic change  such as early osteomyelitis  could result in a false-positive examination. Specificity cannot  therefore  be accurately determined without an actual determination of the pathologic changes within the bone  necessarily involving biopsy. In summary  we believe that we have established bone scintigraphy as an early and accurate means for the detection of lower extremity stress fractures  even in the absence of radiographic findings (6). We feel that a focally abnormal scintigram  in the proper clinical setting  establishes the diagnosis of stress fracture  with radiography to be performed at the time of initial work-up only to rule out a non-stress injury (such as complete fracture  fibrous dysplasia  osteomyelitis  primary bone tumor).',\n",

Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein in turn lead to the cross species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2, may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modelling. The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein respectively. Despite strong overall structural similarities, spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared to the wild type molecule. Most ACE2 variants showed similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein. In summary, our data provide structural basis of potential resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by ACE2 allelic variants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Linkage to chromosome 9p had been reported for pedigrees with the neurodegenerative disorder  frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND). The objective in this study is to identify the genetic locus in a multi-generational Australian family with FTLD-MND. METHODS: Clinical review and standard neuropathological analysis of brain sections from affected pedigree members. Genome-wide scan using microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphism fine mapping. Examination of candidate genes by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Neuropathological examination revealed cytoplasmic deposition of the TDP-43 protein in three affected individuals. Moreover  we identify a family member with clinical Alzheimer's disease  and FTLD-Ubiquitin neuropathology. Genetic linkage and haplotype analyses  defined a critical region between markers D9S169 and D9S1845 on chromosome 9p21. Screening of all candidate genes within this region did not reveal any novel genetic alterations that co-segregate with disease haplotype  suggesting that one individual carrying a meiotic recombination may represent a phenocopy. Re-analysis of linkage data using the new affection status revealed a maximal two-point LOD score of 3.24 and a multipoint LOD score of 3.41 at marker D9S1817. This provides the highest reported LOD scores from a single FTLD-MND pedigree. CONCLUSION: Our reported increase in the minimal disease region should inform other researchers that the chromosome 9 locus may be more telomeric than predicted by published recombination boundaries. Moreover  the existence of a family member with clinical Alzheimer's disease  and who shares the disease haplotype  highlights the possibility that late-onset AD patients in the other linked pedigrees may be mis-classified as sporadic dementia cases.\",\n",

Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) and unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (uSACP) is effective in the elective setting. In this study  the impact of MHCA and uSACP on outcomes for type A repair was evaluated. Methods A retrospective review identified 346 patients who underwent type A repair under circulatory arrest  including 193 patients who had MHCA/uSACP. Measured outcomes included operative mortality  permanent neurologic deficit (PND) and temporary neurologic deficit  renal failure  and tracheostomy. Propensity-adjusted  multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to model adverse outcomes. Results The mean age of MHCA/uSACP patients was 56 years. The mean temperature during MHCA was 26.9 ± 2.0 C. Operative mortality for MHCA/SACP patients was 9.8% compared with 20.3% for the non-MHCA/SACP group (p < 0.01). Propensity score analysis found that MHCA/uSACP did not represent an adverse risk factor for mortality  temporary neurologic deficit  PND  renal failure  or the need for tracheostomy compared with non-MHCA/uSACP techniques. There was a 2.32-fold higher incidence of PND among patients who underwent cross-clamping of the dissected aorta during cooling before circulatory arrest (p < 0.05). Conclusions Emergent type A repair can be accomplished with respectable operative risk using MHCA/uSACP. Cross-clamping the dissected aorta before MHCA increases the incidence of PND. These data suggest that MHCA/uSACP represents an effective circulation management strategy for patients undergoing repair of type A and obviates the need for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. © 2013 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.',\n",

Among other restrictions, it involved a complete ban of alcohol sales. We aimed to examine and interpret the changes in online search interest for keywords representing different alcohol-related themes during the lockdown period in India. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were extracted using the framework described for using Google Trends in health-related research. The list of alcohol-related search queries was prepared for four broad themes: types of alcoholic beverages consumed; means of accessing alcohol; problems experienced due to break in alcohol supply; and help-seeking for alcohol use disorders. The mean relative search volumes across three time periods (pre-lockdown; lockdown 1.0; lockdown 2.0) were compared using spss version 23.0. RESULTS: A significant increase in online search interest for keywords related to the procurement of alcohol was observed in lockdown 1.0 but not during lockdown 2.0, compared with pre-lockdown. A significant increase in online search interest for alcohol withdrawal was observed during lockdown 1.0 compared to the pre-lockdown period. A significant increase in online search interest for keywords representing benzodiazepines was observed in lockdown 2.0. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Indian internet users exhibited significantly increased online interest for alcohol-related searches during lockdown. It seems that the challenges associated with offering interventions for alcohol use-related problems are likely to continue once the lockdown is lifted and people have the option to access alcohol and treatment services freely.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether cognitive impairment in SIVD 1) correlates with measures of ischemic brain injury or brain atrophy  and/or 2) is due to concomitant AD. METHODS: Volumetric MRI of the brain was performed in 1) elderly subjects with lacunes (L) and a spectrum of cognitive impairment-normal cognition (NC+L  n = 32)  mild cognitive impairment (CI+L  n = 26)  and dementia (D+L  n = 29); 2) a comparison group with probable AD (n = 28); and 3) a control group with normal cognition and no lacunes (NC). The authors examined the relationship between the severity of cognitive impairment and 1) volume  number  and location of lacunes; 2) volume of white matter signal hyperintensities (WMSH); and 3) measures of brain atrophy (i. e.  hippocampal  cortical gray matter  and CSF volumes). RESULTS: Among the three lacune groups  severity of cognitive impairment correlated with atrophy of the hippocampus and cortical gray matter  but not with any lacune measure. Although hippocampal atrophy was the best predictor of severity of cognitive impairment  there was evidence for a second  partially independent  atrophic process associated with ventricular dilation  cortical gray matter atrophy  and increase in WMSH. Eight autopsied SIVD cases showed variable severity of ischemic and neurofibrillary degeneration in the hippocampus  but no significant AD pathology in neocortex. The probable AD group gave evidence of only one atrophic process  reflected in the severity of hippocampal atrophy. Comparison of regional neocortical gray matter volumes showed sparing of the primary motor and visual cortices in the probable AD group  but relatively uniform atrophy in the D+L group. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia in SIVD  as in AD  correlates best with hippocampal and cortical atrophy  rather than any measure of lacunes. In SIVD  unlike AD  there is evidence for partial independence between these two atrophic processes. Hippocampal atrophy may result from a mixture of ischemic and degenerative pathologies. The cause of diffuse cortical atrophy is not known  but may be partially indexed by the severity of WMSH.',\n",

Here we show that Taz and Yap also mediate signaling via the AﾎｲPP paralogues APLP1 and APLP2 through interactions with Mint1 and Mint3. APLP1 and APLP2 formed transcriptionally active triple protein complexes with the adaptor protein Mint3 and each of the transcriptional regulators Taz and Yap  and complex formation was regulated by the ﾎｳ-secretase cleavage of APLP1 and APLP2. The presence of Mint1 instead of Mint3 in the complex prevented its translocation to the nucleus. APLP1 displayed much lower transactivation levels compared to AﾎｲPP and APLP2.

We hypothesized that characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity correlate with disease severity. METHODS: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells and antibodies were characterized in uninfected controls and patients with different COVID-19 related disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells were flow-cytometrically quantified after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools and analyzed for expression of cytokines (IFNgamma, IL-2 and TNFalpha) and markers for activation, proliferation and functional anergy. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies were quantified using ELISA. Moreover, global characteristics of lymphocyte subpopulations were compared between patient groups and uninfected controlsResults: Despite severe lymphopenia affecting all major lymphocyte subpopulations, patients with severe disease mounted significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells as compared to convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T-cells dominated over CD8 T-cells and closely correlated with the number of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA- and IgG-levels. Unlike in convalescents, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells in patients with severe disease showed marked alterations in phenotypical and functional properties, which also extended to CD4 and CD8 T-cells in general.

The analysis of biomarkers  representing different neuropathologies  is an important approach reflecting the heterogeneous features of AD and DLB. Neuronal Ca(2+) -sensor protein VILIP-1 has been implicated in the calcium-mediated neuronal injury and pathological change of AD. The CSF VILIP-1 and VILIP-1/Aﾎｲ1-42 levels had enough diagnostic accuracy to allow the detection and differential diagnosis of AD. CSF VILIP-1 is a useful biomarker for AD. Evaluating the CSF levels of VILIP-1 in AD and DLB patients could facilitate clinical diagnosis.\",\n",

Studies using region of interest or voxel-based analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data found significant decline of fractional anisotropy  a marker of fiber tract integrity  in selected white matter areas. We applied a multivariate network analysis based on principal component analysis to fractional anisotropy maps derived from diffusion-weighted scans from 15 AD patients  and 14 elderly healthy controls. Fractional anisotropy maps were obtained from an EPI diffusion sequence using parallel imaging to reduce distortion artifacts. We used high-dimensional image warping to control for partial volume effects due to white matter atrophy in AD. We found a significant regional pattern of fiber changes (p < 0.01) indicating that the integrity of intracortical projecting fiber tracts (including corpus callosum  cingulum and fornix  and frontal  temporal and occipital lobe white matter areas) was reduced  whereas extracortical projecting fiber tracts  including the pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems and somatosensory projections  were relatively preserved in AD. Effects of a univariate analysis were almost entirely contained within the multivariate effect. Our findings illustrate the use of a multivariate approach to fractional anisotropy data that takes advantage of the highly organized structure of anisotropy maps  and is independent of multiple comparison correction and partial volume effects. In agreement with post-mortem evidence  our study demonstrates dissociation between intracortical and extracortical projecting fiber systems in AD in the living human brain.\",\n",

Here  we used metabolic PET  which maps nonfluctuating signals related to total activity  to identify and validate reproducible RSN topographies in healthy and disease populations. In healthy subjects  the dominant (first component) metabolic RSN was topographically similar to the default mode network (DMN).

Consistent task-related deactivation of the \"DMN-like\" dominant metabolic RSN was observed in healthy subjects and early PD patients; in contrast  the subordinate RSNs were activated during task performance. Network deactivation was reduced in advanced PD; this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Time-course comparisons of DMN loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from PD and Alzheimer\\'s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for PD  in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction.

Several studies have investigated the relationship between body weight and brain atrophy  a pathological change preceding dementia  but their results are inconsistent. Therefore  we aimed to evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and cortical atrophy among cognitively normal participants. METHODS: We recruited cognitively normal participants (n = 1 111) who underwent medical checkups and detailed neurologic screening  including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the health screening visits between September 2008 and December 2011. The main outcome was cortical thickness measured using MRI. The number of subjects with five BMI groups in men/women was 9/9  148/258  185/128  149/111  and 64/50 in underweight  normal  overweight  mild obesity  and moderate to severe obesity  respectively. Linear and non-linear relationships between BMI and cortical thickness were examined using multiple linear regression analysis and generalized additive models after adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among men  underweight participants showed significant cortical thinning in the frontal and temporal regions compared to normal weight participants  while overweight and mildly obese participants had greater cortical thicknesses in the frontal region and the frontal  temporal  and occipital regions  respectively. However  cortical thickness in each brain region was not significantly different in normal weight and moderate to severe obesity groups. Among women  the association between BMI and cortical thickness was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that underweight might be an important risk factor for pathological changes in the brain  while overweight or mild obesity may be inversely associated with cortical atrophy in cognitively normal elderly males.',\n",

The aim of this study was to independently assess the diagnostic value of NOTCH3 immunostaining  and determine whether the degree of immunostaining correlates with other disease parameters. We determined NOTCH3 mutation carrier status in 62 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals from 15 CADASIL families.

Epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been examined but Socio-economic aspects of the issue have been less studied. Thus this study aimed to identify the role of human development index (HDI) in the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide. Methods: Information of the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer and data about the HDI 2019 were obtained from the World Bank database. The correlation between incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI parameters were assessed using linear regression. We calculated concentration index (CI) to measure socioeconomic inequality in COVID-19 related mortality & incidence. Results: linear regression analysis showed a direct significant correlation between the incidence and mortality rate from COVID-19 and HDI at the global level. The concentration index was positive for incidence rate (0.62) and mortality rate (0.69) of COVID-19, indicating the higher concentration of the rates among groups with high HDI. Conclusions: The high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in countries with high and very high HDI are remarkable which should be the top priority of interventions for global health policymakers. Also, the health programs should be provided to reduce the burden of this disease in the regions with high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19. Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).',\n",

Given its recent appearance, our current knowledge about the possible influence that this disease can exert on pregnancy is very limited. One of the unknowns to be solved is whether there is a vertical transmission of the infection during pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, the possible presence of this germ in vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid was investigated in four pregnant Caucasian patients affected by mild acute symptoms of COVID-19 during the second trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: There is no laboratory evidence to suggest a possible passage of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected mother to the amniotic fluid. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to expand the investigation of COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy to clarify the real influence that SARS-CoV-2 has on pregnant women and their offspring, as well as those factors that modulate the disease.

The infectiousness and the quick spread across the world make it an important event in everyone\\'s life, often evoking fear. Our study aims at assessing the overall knowledge and perceptions, and identifying the trusted sources of information for both the general public and healthcare personnel. Materials and methods This is a questionnaire-based survey taken by a total of 1,246 respondents, out of which 744 belonged to the healthcare personnel and 502 were laypersons/general public. There were two different questionnaires for both groups. The questions were framed using information from the World Health Organization (WHO), UpToDate, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Center for Disease Control (CDC), National Institute of Health (NIH), and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) website resources. The questions assessed awareness, attitude, and possible practices towards ensuring safety for themselves as well as breaking the chain of transmission. A convenient sampling method was used for data collection. Descriptive statistics [mean(SD), frequency(%)] were used to portray the characteristics of the participants as well as their awareness, sources of information, attitudes, and practices related to SARS-CoV-2. Results The majority (94.3%) of the respondents were Indians. About 80% of the healthcare professionals and 82% of the general public were worried about being infected. Various websites such as ICMR, WHO, CDC, etc., were a major source of information for the healthcare professional while the general public relied on television. Almost 98% of healthcare professionals and 97% of the general public, respectively, identified \\'Difficulty in breathing\" as the main symptom. More than 90% of the respondents in both groups knew and practiced different precautionary measures. A minority of the respondents (28.9% of healthcare professionals and 26.5% of the general public) knew that there was no known cure yet. Almost all respondents from both the groups agreed on seeking medical help if breathing difficulty is involved and self-quarantine if required. Conclusion Most healthcare professionals and the general public that we surveyed were well informed about SARS-CoV-2 and have been taking adequate measures in preventing the spread of the same.

After 7 days, the blood tests showed a significant rise of inflammatory and procoagulant markers, along with a relevant elevation of high-sensitivity Troponin I.

Acute coronary syndrome-ST-elevation myocardial infarction is a relevant complication of COVID-19. Due to high levels of proinflammatory mediators, diffuse coronary thrombosis could occur even in patients without cardiac history or comorbidities.

Several lines of evidence have supported the notion that the proapoptotic property of familial ALS (FALS)-linked mutant Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some FALS cases. Here we found that activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)  a neurotrophic factor originally identified to have the anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activity  protected against neuronal cell death caused by FALS-linked A4T-  G85R- and G93R-SOD1 in a dose-responsive fashion.

This is in clear contrast to the previous finding that ADNF loses its protective activity against neurotoxicity induced by AD-relevant insults  including some familial AD genes and amyloid beta peptide at concentrations of more than 1 nM. Characterization of the neuroprotective activity of ADNF against cell death caused by SOD1 mutants revealed that CaMKIV and certain tyrosine kinases are involved in ADNF-mediated neuroprotection. Moreover  in vivo studies showed that intracerebroventricularly administered ADNF significantly improved motor performance of G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice  a widely used model of FALS  although survival was extended only marginally.

The purpose of this study was to determine what proportion of patients with SVaD lack abnormal amyloid imaging  and to examine differences in the clinical or MRI features between subjects with SVaD with cortical amyloid deposition and those without. METHODS: We measured brain amyloid deposition using (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET in 45 patients (men: women = 19:26; mean age 74.2 ﾂｱ 7.6 years) with SVaD. They all met DSM-IV criteria for vascular dementia and had severe white matter high signal intensities without territorial infarction or macrohemorrhage on MRI. RESULTS: Thirty-one (68.9%) of 45 patients with SVaD were negative for cortical PiB binding.

Besides being involved in angiogenesis  the alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin is also presented on tumor cells of various origin  where it is involved in the processes that govern metastasis. Because the alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin is an attractive target for cancer treatment  high-affinity ligands containing the RGD sequence  for example  cyclic pentapeptides  have been developed. They inhibit angiogenesis  induce endothelial apoptosis  decrease tumor growth  and reduce invasiveness and spread of metastasis. This development finally resulted in cyclo(RGDf(NMe)V) (cilengitide)  which is a drug for the treatment of glioblastoma (currently in phase III clinical trials).

Some of these multimers demonstrated significantly improved affinity (avidity) and targeting efficiency in vivo.

We sought to model the trend of COVID-19 and estimate the restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China. Methods: Real-time data of COVID-19 and population mobility data were extracted from open sources. SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Results: The number of infected people and deaths would increase by 45% and 567% respectively, given that the government only has implemented traffic control in Wuhan without additional medical professionals. The epidemic of Wuhan (measured by cumulative confirmed cases) was predicted to reach turning point at the end of March and end in later April, 2020. The outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was predicted to end at the end of March and the medical service could be fully back to normal in middle of April. During the epidemic, the number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations decreased by 69.86%, 57.41% and 66.85% in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. After the end of epidemic, medical centers located in these metropolises may face 58,799 (95% CI 48926-67,232) additional hospitalization needs in the first month. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively contained and medical service across the country is expected to return to normal in April. However, the huge unmet medical needs for other diseases could result in massive migration of patients and their families, bringing tremendous challenges for medical service in major metropolis and disease control for the potential asymptomatic virus carrier.

METHODS: Neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was used. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using MTT assay and flow cytometry  respectively. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were measured using biochemical methods. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were monitored using 2' 7'-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Secreted ﾎｲ-amyloid(1-42) (Aﾎｲ(1-42)) level was assessed by ELISA. The expression of mRNA of Bcl2  Bax  Caspase3  Aﾎｲ precursor protein (APP)  ﾎｲ-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)  and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) were measured using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR)  and their protein levels were examined using Western blot. RESULTS: RGZ (0.1-10 ﾎｼmol/L) significantly increased the cell viability that was reduced by AGEs (1000 ﾎｼg/mL). RGZ (10 ﾎｼmol/L) significantly ameliorated AGEs-triggered downregulation of SOD and catalase  and production of ROS. It also reversed Bcl2 downregulation  Bax upregulation and Caspase3 expression caused by AGEs. Moreover  it significantly attenuated AGEs-induced Aﾎｲ secretion and APP protein upregulation. RGZ did not affect BACE1 expression  but induced IDE expression  which promoted degradation of Aﾎｲ. All the effects were blocked by the specific PPARﾎｳ antagonist GW9662 (10 ﾎｼmol/L). CONCLUSION: RGZ protects the euroblastoma cells against AGEs-induced injury via its anti-oxidative  anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties that seems to be mediated by PPARﾎｳ activation. The results suggest a beneficial role for RGZ in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Nrf2 reduces levels of phosphorylated tau protein by inducing autophagy adaptor protein NDP52.Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a pivotal transcription factor in the defence against oxidative stress. Here we provide evidence that activation of the Nrf2 pathway reduces the levels of phosphorylated tau by induction of an autophagy adaptor protein NDP52 (also known as CALCOCO2) in neurons. The expression of NDP52  which we show has three antioxidant response elements (AREs) in its promoter region  is strongly induced by Nrf2  and its overexpression facilitates clearance of phosphorylated tau in the presence of an autophagy stimulator. In Nrf2-knockout mice  phosphorylated and sarkosyl-insoluble tau accumulates in the brains concurrent with decreased levels of NDP52. Moreover  NDP52 associates with phosphorylated tau from brain cortical samples of Alzheimer disease cases  and the amount of phosphorylated tau in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions is inversely proportional to that of NDP52. These results suggest that NDP52 plays a key role in autophagy-mediated degradation of phosphorylated tau in vivo.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'First report of manic-like symptoms in a COVID-19 patient with no previous history of a psychiatric disorderBACKGROUND: In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection was first reported in Wuhan city, central China, which has spread rapidly. The common clinical features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection included fever, fatigue, and damage to the respiratory or digestive system. However, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause damage to the central nervous system (CNS) inducing psychiatric symptoms. CASE REPORT: Herein, we present the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with manic-like symptoms and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the case, focusing on the identifications of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient developed manic-like symptoms when his vital signs recovered on illness day 17. After manic-like attack, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in CSF was positive, while the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on CSF for the SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient received Olanzapine for treatment and his mood problems concurrently improved as indicated by scores of Young Manic Rating Scale (YMRS). LIMITATION: This is a single case report only, and the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was not performed simultaneously when SARS-CoV-2 was positive in samples of sputum and stool. CONCLUSION: This first case of COVID-19 patient with manic-like symptoms highlights the importance of evaluation of mental health status and may contribute to our understanding of potential risk of CNS impairments by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In order to investigate how changes in 5-HT2A levels and functionality relate to the progressive accumulation of Abeta protein  we studied 5-HT2A receptor regulation in double transgenic AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice which display excess production of Abeta and age-dependent increase in amyloid plaques. Three different age-groups  4-month-old  8- month-old  and 11-month-old were included in the study. [3H]-MDL100907  [3H]-escitalopram  and [11C]-PIB autoradiography was performed for measuring 5-HT2A receptor  serotonin transporter (SERT)  and Abeta plaque levels in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)  prefrontal cortex (PFC)  frontoparietal cortex (FPC)  dorsal and ventral hippocampus  and somatosensory cortex. To investigate 5-HT2A receptor functionality  animals were treated with the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI and head-twitch response (HTR) subsequently recorded. Expression level of the immediate early gene c-fos was measured by in situ hybridization. We found that the age-related increase in Abeta plaque burden was accompanied by a significant decrease in 5-HT2A receptor binding in mPFC in the 11-month-old group. The changes in 5-HT2A receptor binding correlated negatively with [11C]-PIB binding and were not accompanied by decreases in SERT binding. Correspondingly  11-month-old transgenic mice showed diminished DOI-induced HTR and reduced increase in expression of c-fos mRNA in mPFC and FPC. These observations point towards a direct association between Abeta accumulation and changes in 5-HT2A receptor expression that is independent of upstream changes in the serotonergic system.',\n",

It is a challenge to clinicians to define the adequate place of imaging studies in order to recognize relevant organic disease. Transabdominal ultrasound is nowadays clinically useful in detecting inflammatory bowel diseases and is also widely used as first line study in recurrent abdominal pain. In the literature there are few publications concerning ultrasound (US) appearance of the gastric and duodenal peptic ulcer. We report a case of a Chinese boy suffering from middle abdominal pain associated with vomiting, whose peptic ulcer was firstly recognized through an accurate small bowel US. H.F, a 14-yearold boy, presented to our Clinic with a sudden intensification of a 2 year history of daily abdominal pain localized in the middle quadrant, pain was never displayed overnight and was associated with several episodes of vomiting and significant loss of weight. He recalled no inciting event and denied fever, diarrhea or constipation, blood or mucus in faeces, hematemesis, hematuria, or dysuria. On presentation, the patient was afebrile, his abdomen was soft with no peritoneal signs or palpable masses. Laboratory data revealed normal white blood count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver function tests and urinalysis; serological screening for coeliac disease was negative. Bowel US, performed using for the first evaluation a broadband convex transducer (frequency: 3.5-5 MHz) and then a microconvex transducer (frequency: 4-8 MHz), showed a thickened duodenal wall characterized by the presence of echogenic spots surrounded by hypoechoic rims suggestive of deep ulcers; besides duodenal stenosis caused stomach distension which did not disappear even after suctioning of 300 ml of caffean liquid through a gastroscope. Abdomen X-ray did not show any signs of intestinal occlusion; a surgical evaluation excluded an acute abdomen. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed bowel ultrasound imaging: a not crossable stenotic pylorus with a intrapyloric deep ulcer was found. Gastric biopsies processed for rapid urease test and histopathology examination revealed Helicobacter pylori infection. Eradication treatment with a 14-day course of amoxicillin (1 g bid) and clarithromycin (250mgbid), and a 30-day course of omeprazole (30mg bid) was then started. The patient reported clinical improvement; four weeks after completing therapy the urea breath test was negative. This case report highlights the importance of bowel ultrasound not only as a clinically important first line tool in assessing patients with IBD, but also in different organic diseases such as Helicobacter pylori ulcers.',\n",

Cancer patients are one of the potentially most vulnerable cohorts of people, but data about their management are still few. Patients and Methods: In this monocentric retrospective study we included all SARS-CoV-2 oncological patients accepted, between March 27th and April 19th 2020, at the Onco-COVID Unit at San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, one of the few Italian oncological-COVID wards. Data were obtained from medical records. Result(s): Eighteen cancer patients with COVID-19 were included. The mean (+/-SD) age of patients was 67 +/- 14 years, 89% were men. Seven (39%) developed infection in communities and 11 (61%) during hospitalization. Lung cancer was the most frequent type of cancer (10, 56%). Seven patients (39%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of diagnosis and symptoms began 2 (+/-2) days before. The most common were shortness of breath and diarrhea. Fever was present in 5 patients (28%). Among the 11 asymptomatic patients, 8 (73%) became symptomatic during the hospitalization (mean time of symptoms onset 4 days +/-4). Six patients (33%) were on active anti-tumor treatment: 2 (33%) received anti-tumor therapy within 2 weeks before the infection diagnosis and 2 (33%) continued oncological treatment after SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Eight (44%) patients died within a mean of 12 days (+/-8) from the infection diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Our series confirms the high mortality among cancer patients with COVID-19. The presence of asymptomatic cases evidences that typical symptoms and fever are not the only parameters to suspect the infection. The Onco-Covid unit suggests the importance of a tailored and holistic approach, even in this difficult situation.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Reale, Bironzo, Bertaglia, Palesandro, Leone, Tabbo, Bungaro, Audisio, Mariniello, Rapetti, Di Stefano, Artusio, Capelletto, Sperone, Boccuzzi, Calandri, Perboni, Malapelle, Passiglia and Novello.',\n",

Part of the fornix is directly attached to the corpus callosum  and another part is suspended from the corpus callosum via the septum pellucidum. DTI can be used to evaluate the morphology and microstructural integrity of the fornix. We examined the pattern of fornix damage in patients with iNPH or AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 22 patients with iNPH  20 with AD  and 20 healthy controls. DTI data were obtained. The morphology (volume  length  and mean cross-sectional area) and FA values of the fornix were evaluated by using tract-specific analysis and compared among groups. RESULTS: The volume  cross-sectional area  and FA value of the fornix were significantly smaller in patients with iNPH than in controls  whereas the length was significantly greater. In patients with AD  the volume  mean cross-sectional area  and FA value of the fornix were significantly smaller than those in controls  whereas the length was not altered. The fornix was significantly longer in patients with iNPH than in patients with AD  whereas the volume and cross-sectional areas were significantly smaller. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the different pathogeneses of these diseases lead to fornix damage through different mechanisms: through mechanical stretching due to lateral ventricular enlargement and corpus callosum deformation in patients with iNPH  and through degeneration secondary to hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD.',\n",

However, empiric data on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children and in educational settings are scarce. In Australia, most schools have remained open during the first epidemic wave, albeit with reduced student physical attendance at the epidemic peak. We examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children and staff in schools and early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed paediatric (aged <=18 years) and adult COVID-19 cases who attended a school or ECEC setting while considered infectious (defined as 24 h before symptom onset based on national guidelines during the study period) in NSW from Jan 25 to April 10, 2020, were investigated for onward transmission. All identified school and ECEC settings close contacts were required to home quarantine for 14 days, and were monitored and offered SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing if symptomatic. Enhanced investigations in selected educational settings included nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts. Secondary attack rates were calculated and compared with state-wide COVID-19 rates. FINDINGS: 15 schools and ten ECEC settings had children (n=12) or adults (n=15) attend while infectious, with 1448 contacts monitored. Of these, 633 (43.7%) of 1448 had nucleic acid testing, or antibody testing, or both, with 18 secondary cases identified (attack rate 1.2%). Five secondary cases (three children; two adults) were identified (attack rate 0.5%; 5/914) in three schools. No secondary transmission occurred in nine of ten ECEC settings among 497 contacts. However, one outbreak in an ECEC setting involved transmission to six adults and seven children (attack rate 35.1%; 13/37). Across all settings, five (28.0%) of 18 secondary infections were asymptomatic (three infants [all aged 1 year], one adolescent [age 15 years], and one adult). INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates were low in NSW educational settings during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave, consistent with mild infrequent disease in the 1.8 million child population. With effective case-contact testing and epidemic management strategies and associated small numbers of attendances while infected, children and teachers did not contribute significantly to COVID-19 transmission via attendance in educational settings. These findings could be used to inform modelling and public health policy regarding school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. FUNDING: NSW Government Department of Health.

The limited data that exists regarding the utility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in these critically ill patients shows poor overall outcomes. This paper describes our institutional practice regarding the application and management of ECMO support for patients with Covid-19 and reports promising early outcomes. METHODS: All critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19 evaluated for ECMO support from March 10th, 2020-April 24th, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were selected for ECMO support based on a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio<150 mmHg OR pH<7.25 with a pCO2>60 mmHg with no life-limiting comorbidities. Patients were cannulated at bedside and were managed with protective lung ventilation, early tracheostomy, bronchoscopies and proning as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Of 321 patients intubated for Covid-19, 77 (24%) patients were evaluated for ECMO support with 27 (8.4%) patients placed on ECMO. All patients were placed on veno-venous ECMO. Current survival is 96.3%, with only one mortality to date in over 350 days of total ECMO support. Thirteen patients (48.1%) remain on ECMO support, while 13 patients (48.1%) have been successfully decannulated. Seven patients (25.9%) have been discharged from the hospital. Six patients (22.2%) remain in the hospital of which four are on room-air. No healthcare workers that participated in ECMO cannulation developed symptoms of or tested positive for Covid-19.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 0 of 9 exhaled breath samples, 2 of 8 exhaled breath condensate samples, 1 of 12 bedside air samples, 4 of 132 samples from private surfaces, 0 of 70 samples from frequently touched public surfaces in isolation rooms, and 7 of 23 feces-related air/surface/water samples. The maximum viral RNA concentrations were 1857 copies/m3 in the air, 38 copies/cm2 in sampled surfaces and 3092 copies/mL in sewage/wastewater samples. Our results suggest that nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur via multiple routes. However, the low detection frequency and limited quantity of viral RNA from the breath and environmental specimens may be related to the reduced viral load of the COVID-19 patients on later days after symptom onset. These findings suggest that the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 differ from those of SARS-CoV in healthcare settings.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",

Therefore  activation of mechanisms that lower brain Abeta levels is considered valuable for AD therapy. Neuronal upregulation of neprilysin (NEP) in young transgenic mice expressing the AD-causing amyloid precursor protein mutations (SwAPP) led to reduction of brain Abeta levels and delayed Abeta plaque deposition. In contrast  a comparable increase of brain NEP levels in aged SwAPP mice with pre-existing plaque pathology did not result in a significant reduction of plaque pathology. Therefore  we suggest that the potential of NEP for AD therapy is age-dependent and most effective early in the course of AD pathophysiology.\",\n",

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and genetic studies of dementia have rarely been reported in an Arab population. METHODS: All persons aged 60 years or older who were residents of the rural area of Wadi Ara were examined for identification of DAT  vascular dementia (VaD) and conversion from age related cognitive decline (ARCD) to DAT using DSM-IV criteria and a semi-structured questionnaire for collection of demographic and medical data. ApoE genotype was also determined. Total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) was determined using HPLC with fluorescence detection. Vitamins B12 and plasma folate were determined using a commercial radioisotope dilution kit assay (ICN). RESULTS: DAT was diagnosed in 20.5% of this population. Its prevalence increased steeply with age. Illiteracy was very common  and strongly associated with higher prevalence of DAT. The annual incidence of DAT among ARCD cases was 4.4%. Subjects with ARCD who developed DAT were older than ARCD subjects who did not develop dementia. Hypertension was significantly more common among converted patients than among non-converted. Illiteracy was insignificantly more common among those who developed DAT than among those who remained ARCD. Vascular dementia (VaD) constitutes about 22% of the total dementia population. We also confirm the association between VaD  illiteracy and hypertension. Smoking did not represent a risk factor for VaD. The survival rates among the three groups (healthy subjects  ARCD and DAT) was 80.5%  58.8% and 55.5% respectively. Homocysteine levels were significantly higher than found in studies in Cleveland. Plasma B12 and plasma folate levels did not differ significantly between DAT patients and controls after adjusting for year of birth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Wadi Ara population is unique because of high prevalence rates of dementia. We found old age  female gender and lack of education to be risk factors for the development of DAT. The ApoE epsilon4 allele is relatively uncommon in this population and it cannot explain the high DAT prevalence. We also confirm the association between VaD  illiteracy and hypertension and older age and hypertension are risk factors for the transformation of ARCD to DAT.\",\n",

It is now a global pandemic and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be a Betacoronavirus (lineage B) closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been reported to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Subsequently betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineage A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.

Given that the clinical effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) has still been questioned due to dubious disease-modifying effects  the multi-target directed ligand (MTDL) design has become an emerging strategy for developing new drugs for AD treatment. Bis(9)-(-)-nor-meptazinol (Bis-Mep) was firstly reported by us as a novel MTDL for both potent cholinesterase and amyloid-ﾎｲ aggregation inhibition. In this study  we further explored its AChE inhibition kinetic features and cognitive amelioration. Bis-Mep was found to be a mixed-type inhibitor on electric eel AChE by enzyme kinetic study. Molecular docking revealed that two \"water bridges\" located at the two wings of Bis-Mep stabilized its interaction with both catalytic and peripheral anionic sites of AChE. Furthermore  subcutaneous administration of Bis-Mep (10  100 or 1000 ng/kg) significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced memory deficits in a typical bell-shaped dose-response manner. The maximal cognitive amelioration of Bis-Mep was achieved at 100 ng/kg  comparable with the effect of a reference drug Huperzine A at 1 mg/kg and also the relevant AChE inhibition in brain. These findings suggested that Bis-Mep might be a promising dual-binding AChE inhibitor for potential AD therapeutics.',\n",

PURPOSE: To investigate the ADC value for aMCI and AD using Brain Search (BS) software based on anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total  174 aged people were screened  and 25 patients with AD  26 patients with aMCI  and 18 normal controls (NCs) were recruited. DWI was performed at 1.5 T with a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)  and the independent ADC mapping was generated after imaging acquisition. Ninety regional parcellations were adopted in a Brain Search (BS) based on the automated anatomic labeling atlas. The gray scale intensities (water diffusivity) from the collected ADC mappings were analyzed with BS. The mean value of each anatomical brain region was compared among aMCI  AD  and NC. The statistically significant (P < 0.05) group differences are displayed in color. RESULTS: During the pathological process of AD  the changes of water diffusivity appeared first in the left hippocampus  then gradually progressed to the bilateral sides and eventually displayed right lateralization. The ADC values from aMCI were obviously elevated compared to the values from the NC group in the left limbic cortex. Between the AD and NC groups  the significantly different brain areas included the bilateral hippocampus  the Cingulum_Mid  the ParaHippocampal_R  and the Temporal and Frontal lobes. There was a negative correlation between the ADC values and the scores from MMSE  MoCA  the Digit test  Raven's IQ  and WAIS IQ. Additionally  the ADC values were positively correlated with the scores from CDR  ADL  and ADAS-Cog. CONCLUSION: The water diffusivity for aMCI and AD displays asymmetric anatomical lateralization.

Moreover  it has been observed that GRP78  a stress-response protein induced by conditions that adversely affect endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function  is reduced in the brain of AD patients. In this study  we investigated the correlation between the expression of Abeta and GRP78 in the brain cortex of mice chronically treated with aluminium sulphate.

This conjecture has considerable impact on the treatment of cancer patients and large, multi-centre data to support this assumption is lacking due to the contingencies of the pandemic. Method(s): The cancer community of the United Kingdom (UK) has launched the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effect of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Result(s): An analysis of the first 800 cancer patients with symptomatic COVID-19 disease entered into the UKCCMP registry has been performed. Approximately half of these patients have a mild COVID-19 disease course (52%). Mortality was observed in 226 patients (28%) and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age, sex (M>F) and the presence of other co-morbidities. Approximately one third had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities, recent receipt of chemotherapy had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared to cancer patients who had not received recent chemotherapy. No significant effect on mortality was also observed for patients with recent immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy or radiotherapy use. Conclusion(s): Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, sex and co-morbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anti-cancer treatment are at significantly increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared to those not on active treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the causative mutation in a large family with autosomal dominant inheritance of TAAD with intracranial and abdominal aortic aneurysms by performing exome sequencing of 2 distantly related individuals with TAAD and identifying shared rare variants. METHODS AND RESULTS: A novel frame shift mutation  p.

Using SPM voxel-based analysis  we looked for correlations between FAB performance and brain SPECT perfusion in 47 patients with the frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia (fv-FTD) recruited by the French FTD research network  a multicentre initiative of French University hospitals with expertise in the field of dementia. A significant correlation was found between FAB performance and perfusion in the medial and dorsolateral frontal cortex bilaterally  independently of age  gender and MMSE. No correlations were observed with orbital frontal or parietal perfusion  in spite of the presence of hypoperfusion in these areas  or with perfusion of any other cortical or subcortical region. These findings confirm that the FAB is an adequate tool for assessing functions related to the dorsolateral and medial frontal cortex  and is thus useful for the evaluation of diseases associated with frontal dysfunction.',\n",

Here  we investigated information sampling in mild Dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and healthy aging by using the Information Sampling Task (IST). METHOD: In a first investigation  we compared patients with mild DAT (n = 20) with healthy controls (n = 20) on the IST and several neuropsychological background tests. In a second investigation  healthy older adults (n = 30) were compared with younger adults (n = 30) on the IST and executive-function tasks. RESULTS: Results of the first investigation demonstrated that  in the IST  patients gathered significantly less information  made riskier and less accurate decisions  and showed less reward sensitivity relative to controls. We found a significant correlation between performance on the IST and performance on tests of verbal fluency  working memory  and recognition in patients but not in controls. Results of the second investigation indicated a largely similar performance pattern between healthy older adults and younger adults. There were no significant correlations for both groups between the IST and executive-function tasks. CONCLUSIONS: There are no relevant changes with healthy aging in predecisional processing. In contrast  mild DAT significantly affects predecisional information sampling. Thus  the problems shown in patients with mild DAT in decision making might be related to the patients' difficulties in predecisional processing. Decision-making performance in mild DAT might be improved by helping the patients at a predecisional stage to gather sufficient information and evaluate options more accurately.\",\n",

Divalent metal ions such as Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) are known to significantly affect the rate of aggregation and morphology of Abeta assemblies in vitro and are also found at elevated levels within cerebral plaques in vivo. The present investigation characterized the architecture of the aggregated forms of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in the presence or absence of either Cu(2+) or Zn(2+) using quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange combined with solution NMR spectroscopy. The NMR analyses provide a quantitative and residue-specific structural characterization of metal-induced Abeta aggregates  showing that both the peptide sequence and the type of metal ion exert an impact on the final architecture. Common features among the metal-complexed peptide aggregates are two solvent-protected regions with an intervening minimum centered at Asn27  and a solvent-accessible N-terminal region  Asp1-Lys16. Our results suggest that Abeta in complex with either Cu(2+) or Zn(2+) can attain an aggregation-prone beta-strand-turn-beta-strand motif  similar to the motif found in fibrils  but where the metal binding to the N-terminal region guides the peptide into an assembly distinctly different from the fibril form.\",\n",

We recently reported that this protein  normally associated with neurodegenerative conditions  is expressed by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We now report that the differential processing of AbetaPP via secretase enzymes regulates the proliferation and differentiation of hESCs. hESCs endogenously produce amyloid-beta  which when added exogenously in soluble and fibrillar forms but not oligomeric forms markedly increased hESC proliferation. The inhibition of AbetaPP cleavage by beta-secretase inhibitors significantly suppressed hESC proliferation and promoted nestin expression  an early marker of neural precursor cell (NPC) formation. The induction of NPC differentiation via the non-amyloidogenic pathway was confirmed by the addition of secreted AbetaPPalpha  which suppressed hESC proliferation and promoted the formation of NPCs.

As assay protocols and primer sequences become widely known, many laboratories perform diagnostic tests using methods such as RT-PCR or reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Here, we report an RT-LAMP isothermal assay for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and demonstrate the assay on clinical samples using a simple and accessible point-of-care (POC) instrument. We characterized the assay by dipping swabs into synthetic nasal fluid spiked with the virus, moving the swab to viral transport medium (VTM), and sampling a volume of the VTM to perform the RT-LAMP assay without an RNA extraction kit. The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 RNA copies per muL in the VTM solution within 30 min. We further demonstrate our assay by detecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses from 20 clinical samples. Finally, we demonstrate a portable and real-time POC device to detect SARS-CoV-2 from VTM samples using an additively manufactured three-dimensional cartridge and a smartphone-based reader. The POC system was tested using 10 clinical samples, and was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 from these clinical samples by distinguishing positive samples from negative samples after 30 min. The POC tests are in complete agreement with RT-PCR controls. This work demonstrates an alternative pathway for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that does not require conventional laboratory infrastructure, in settings where diagnosis is required at the point of sample collection.

Modulation of H2O2 and cytokine induction in human leukocytes.A proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP) has immunoregulatory properties and also shows beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is known that the unregulated activation of microglial cells in AD may result in chronic inflammatory response. There is a link between the activation of immune cells on the periphery and in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore  we studied the effect of the PRP on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by LPS with PHA (LP) or PMA as proinflammatory activators. PRP and its nonapeptide fragment (NP) inhibited by 40-60% production of H(2)O(2) induced by PMA. The peptides also inhibited activity of superoxide dismutase. Both peptide preparations showed differential effects on the secretion of cytokines. NP induced TNF-alpha only while PRP induced IL-6  IL-10 and TNF-alpha. On the other hand  the release of TNF-alpha and IL-10 induced by LP in PBMCs was inhibited by PRP while NP inhibited the release of IFN-gamma and IL-10. The results obtained showed that PRP may affect not only adaptive immunity but also innate immunity and thus may regulate secretions of mediators of inflammation. The regulatory effect of the PRP on the innate immunity may shed some light on understanding the beneficial effects of this polypeptide complex in AD patients.\",\n",

[Chinese]Objective * To explore the correlation patterns of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in various provincial administrative regions in China at the early stage of the epidemic, and forecast the following development of epidemic situation. Methods * The data on the COVID-19 epidemic situation in various provincial administrative regions in China published by National Health Commission of People's Republic of China from Jan. 13 to Feb. 13, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. The elbow cluster analysis method was used to cluster the provincial administrative regions. The SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model was used to calculate the basic infection number (R0) of different clusters, whose changing trends were also predicted. Results * According to the prevalence rates, the 34 provincial administrative regions were divided into four types of clusters: Cluster I (22 provincial administrative regions), Cluster II (9 provincial administrative regions), Cluster III (2 provincial administrative regions) and Cluster IV (Hubei). The prevalence rate of Hubei was higher than those of other clusters (P=0.000), but the differences in the cure rate and the case-fatality rate among the four clusters were not statistically significant; the R0 values based on the SEIR model of them were 2.764, 3.056, 3.899 and 3.984, respectively. By Feb. 13, 2020, except for Hubei, the cumulative prevalence curves of the other clusters tended to be stable and the cure rates increased. The prevalence rate and case-fatality rate of Hubei were still higher, and the cure rate was lower. Conclusion * From Jan. 13 to Feb. 13, 2020, 34 provincial administrative regions in China can be divided into four clusters according to the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic, and the prevalence rate of Cluster IV was significantly higher than those of other three clusters; by Feb. 13, 2020, the epidemic situations in the Cluster I, II and III has been alleviated, and the epidemic situation in Cluster IV areas were still severe.Copyright Â© 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

The order of aggregation events is still under debate  but it is well accepted that tau-related changes have an important impact on the viability of neurons. In neurons  early morphological changes are seen in axons which begin to loose and retract synapses. This process is accompanied by an increase of aggregated tau protein. Thus the prevention of tau aggregation seems to be a valuable target for therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Here we present a screening procedure by which we identified inhibitors of tau polymerization. In the primary screen we used a thioflavin-S based assay which detects PHF formation in solution. These initial hits were further analyzed for their capacity to depolymerize preformed PHFs. These results were confirmed by several secondary assays (tryptophan fluorescence  pelleting  filter trapping and electron microscopy). By this approach it is possible to identify small molecule compounds which prevent or reverse the aggregation of tau and thereby might improve the viability of neurons in a therapeutic approach.\",\n",

A multidisciplinary approach is warranted to optimize outcome for both the mother and her fetus. The aim of this document is to provide the obstetric care provider with an evidence-based systematic approach to the pregnant trauma patient. OUTCOMES: Significant health and economic outcomes considered in comparing alternative practices. EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline  CINAHL  and The Cochrane Library from October 2007 to September 2013 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g.  pregnancy  Cesarean section  hypotension  domestic violence  shock) and key words (e.g.  trauma  perimortem Cesarean  Kleihauer-Betke  supine hypotension  electrical shock). Results were restricted to systematic reviews  randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials  and observational studies published in English between January 1968 and September 2013. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to February 2014. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies  clinical practice guideline collections  clinical trial registries  and national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). BENEFITS  HARMS  AND COSTS: This guideline is expected to facilitate optimal and uniform care for pregnancies complicated by trauma. Summary Statement Specific traumatic injuries At this time  there is insufficient evidence to support the practice of disabling air bags for pregnant women. (III) Recommendations Primary survey 1. Every female of reproductive age with significant injuries should be considered pregnant until proven otherwise by a definitive pregnancy test or ultrasound scan. (III-C) 2. A nasogastric tube should be inserted in a semiconscious or unconscious injured pregnant woman to prevent aspiration of acidic gastric content. (III-C) 3. Oxygen supplementation should be given to maintain maternal oxygen saturation > 95% to ensure adequate fetal oxygenation. (II-1B) 4. If needed  a thoracostomy tube should be inserted in an injured pregnant woman 1 or 2 intercostal spaces higher than usual. (III-C) 5. Two large bore (14 to 16 gauge) intravenous lines should be placed in a seriously injured pregnant woman. (III-C) 6. Because of their adverse effect on uteroplacental perfusion  vasopressors in pregnant women should be used only for intractable hypotension that is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. (II-3B) 7. After mid-pregnancy  the gravid uterus should be moved off the inferior vena cava to increase venous return and cardiac output in the acutely injured pregnant woman. This may be achieved by manual displacement of the uterus or left lateral tilt. Care should be taken to secure the spinal cord when using left lateral tilt. (II-1B) 8. To avoid rhesus D (Rh) alloimmunization in Rh-negative mothers  O-negative blood should be transfused when needed until cross-matched blood becomes available. (I-A) 9. The abdominal portion of military anti-shock trousers should not be inflated on a pregnant woman because this may reduce placental perfusion. (II-3B) Transfer to health care facility 10. Transfer or transport to a maternity facility (triage of a labour and delivery unit) is advocated when injuries are neither life- nor limb-threatening and the fetus is viable (> 23 weeks)  and to the emergency room when the fetus is under 23 weeks' gestational age or considered to be non-viable. When the injury is major  the patient should be transferred or transported to the trauma unit or emergency room  regardless of gestational age. (III-B) 11. When the severity of injury is undetermined or when the gestational age is uncertain  the patient should be evaluated in the trauma unit or emergency room to rule out major injuries. (III-C) Evaluation of a pregnant trauma patient in the emergency room 12. In cases of major trauma  the assessment  stabilization  and care of the pregnant women is the first priority; then  if the fetus is viable (> 23 weeks)  fetal heart rate auscultation and fetal monitoring can be initiated and an obstetrical consultation obtained as soon as feasible. (II-3B) 13. In pregnant women with a viable fetus (> 23 weeks) and suspected uterine contractions  placental abruption  or traumatic uterine rupture  urgent obstetrical consultation is recommended. (II-3B) 14. In cases of vaginal bleeding at or after 23 weeks  speculum or digital vaginal examination should be deferred until placenta previa is excluded by a prior or current ultrasound scan. (III-C) Adjunctive tests for maternal assessment 15. Radiographic studies indicated for maternal evaluation including abdominal computed tomography should not be deferred or delayed due to concerns regarding fetal exposure to radiation. (II-2B) 16. Use of gadolinium-based contrast agents can be considered when maternal benefit outweighs potential fetal risks. (III-C) 17. In addition to the routine blood tests  a pregnant trauma patient should have a coagulation panel including fibrinogen. (III-C) 18. Focused abdominal sonography for trauma should be considered for detection of intraperitoneal bleeding in pregnant trauma patients. (II-3B) 19. Abdominal computed tomography may be considered as an alternative to diagnostic peritoneal lavage or open lavage when intra-abdominal bleeding is suspected. (III-C) Fetal assessment 20. All pregnant trauma patients with a viable pregnancy (> 23 weeks) should undergo electronic fetal monitoring for at least 4 hours. (II-3B) 21. Pregnant trauma patients (> 23 weeks) with adverse factors including uterine tenderness  significant abdominal pain  vaginal bleeding  sustained contractions (> 1/10 min)  rupture of the membranes  atypical or abnormal fetal heart rate pattern  high risk mechanism of injury  or serum fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL should be admitted for observation for 24 hours. (III-B) 22. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to all rhesus D-negative pregnant trauma patients. (III-B) 23. In Rh-negative pregnant trauma patients  quantification of maternal-fetal hemorrhage by tests such as Kleihauer-Betke should be done to determine the need for additional doses of anti-D immunoglobulin. (III-B) 24. An urgent obstetrical ultrasound scan should be undertaken when the gestational age is undetermined and need for delivery is anticipated. (III-C) 25. All pregnant trauma patients with a viable pregnancy who are admitted for fetal monitoring for greater than 4 hours should have an obstetrical ultrasound prior to discharge from hospital. (III-C) 26. Fetal well-being should be carefully documented in cases involving violence  especially for legal purposes. (III-C) Obstetrical complications of trauma 27. Management of suspected placental abruption should not be delayed pending confirmation by ultrasonography as ultrasound is not a sensitive tool for its diagnosis. (II-3D) Specific traumatic injuries 28. Tetanus vaccination is safe in pregnancy and should be given when indicated. (II-3B) 29. Every woman who sustains trauma should be questioned specifically about domestic or intimate partner violence. (II-3B) 30. During prenatal visits  the caregiver should emphasize the importance of wearing seatbelts properly at all times. (II-2B) Perimortem Caesarean section 31. A Caesarean section should be performed for viable pregnancies (> 23 weeks) no later than 4 minutes (when possible) following maternal cardiac arrest to aid with maternal resuscitation and fetal salvage.

The exact prevalence is unknown but it is estimated that mesotheliomas represent less than 1% of all cancers. Its incidence is increasing  with an expected peak in the next 10-20 years. Pleural malignant mesothelioma is the most common form of mesothelioma. Typical presenting features are those of chest pain and dyspnoea. Breathlessness due to a pleural effusion without chest pain is reported in about 30% of patients. A chest wall mass  weight loss  sweating  abdominal pain and ascites (due to peritoneal involvement) are less common presentations. Mesothelioma is directly attributable to occupational asbestos exposure with a history of exposure in over 90% of cases. There is also evidence that mesothelioma may result from both para-occupational exposure and non-occupational \"environmental\" exposure. Idiopathic or spontaneous mesothelioma can also occur in the absence of any exposure to asbestos  with a spontaneous rate in humans of around one per million. A combination of accurate exposure history  along with examination radiology and pathology are essential to make the diagnosis. Distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease can be challenging. The most helpful CT findings suggesting malignant pleural disease are 1) a circumferential pleural rind  2) nodular pleural thickening  3) pleural thickening of ¿ 1 cm and 4) mediastinal pleural involvement.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and causes GI symptoms, but also increases nosocomial transmission risk during endoscopic procedures for aerosol generation. We hereby share our infection control strategies aiming to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the endoscopy center. METHODS: We established our infection control strategies based on the guidance of Chinese Society of Digestive Endoscopy and inputs from hospital infection control experts: admission control through the procedure and patient triage, environmental control to reduce possible virus exposure, proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and scope disinfection and room decontamination. All endoscopic procedures accomplished during COVID-19 outbreak and progress of stepwise resumption of elective endoscopy procedures were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Only urgent or semi-urgent procedures were performed during COVID-19 outbreak. After no local new-onset COVID-19 case in Beijing for four weeks, we reopened the endoscopy center for elective procedures and monitored the outbreak continuously while maintaining a sustainable endoscopy service.

In addition, several changes in the coagulation processes have been observed. To date, it's not fully clear how COVID-19 may affect patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. Anticoagulation in patients with haemophilia is still debated, but in this case could be needed. We are reporting a case of an elderly patient with mild haemophilia A hospitalized for Sars-Cov-2. On the 15th day of hospitalization, we observed an increase of all coagulation parameters. An antithrombotic prophylaxis at low dosage was immediately started, then increased at prophylactic dosage. Even if much more data are needed to ascertain the real thrombotic risk of haemophilia A in COVID-19 patients, it's clear that the FVIII and vWF should be strictly monitored in order to promptly establish an adequate treatment and avoid the onset of thromboembolic events, even fatal, causing many deaths in COVID-19 patients.\",\n",

METHODS: Twenty patients with AD and 25 CN subjects had MRI scans and clinical evaluations twice approximately 1.9 years apart. ERC volumes were measured manually and hippocampal volumes were measured semiautomatically on volumetric T1-weighted MR images. RESULTS: In AD  the atrophy rate of ERC (7.1 +/- 3.2%/year) was higher (p < 0.02) than that of hippocampus (5.9 +/- 2.4%/year). Furthermore  memory deficit in mild AD  measured with the Delayed List Verbal Recall test  correlated significantly with atrophy rates of both ERC (r = -0.61) and hippocampus (r = -0.59). Atrophy rates of ERC and hippocampus were comparable in differentiating between AD and CN. Using atrophy rates of ERC or hippocampus to detect a 20% treatment effect with 90% power (p < 0.05) would require about 100 completed patients per arm in a 2-year study.

In the present study  we investigated a series of compounds as potent 19F probes that could prevent the reduction in MR signal when bound to amyloid plaques in the brain. Each compound consists of styrylbenzoxazole as a core structure linked by a different length of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain to one of three types of fluorine-labeled group: a trifluoroethoxy group  a hexafluoroisopropoxy group  or a 3' 5'-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzylamino group.

Our aim was to use the COVID-19 pandemic as positive control to assess the ability to quantify behavioral changes in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from smartphone data. METHODS: Eight participants used the Beiwe smartphone application which passively measured their location during the COVID-19 outbreak. We used interrupted time series to quantify the effect of the US state of emergency declaration on daily home time and daily distance traveled. RESULTS: After the state of emergency declaration, median daily home time increased from 19.4 hours (IQR: 15.4-22.0) to 23.7 hours (IQR: 22.2-24.0) and median distance traveled decreased from 42 km (IQR: 13-83) to 3.7 km (IQR: 1.5-10.3). The participant with the lowest functional ability changed behavior earlier. This participant stayed at home more and traveled less than the participant with highest functional ability, both before and after the state of emergency. DISCUSSION: We provide evidence that smartphone-based digital phenotyping can quantify the behavior of people with ALS. Even though participants spent large amounts of time at home at baseline, the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration reduced their mobility further. Given participants' high daily home time, it is possible that their exposure to COVID-19 could be lower than that of the general population.\",\n",

The population was generally susceptible. However, reports on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were very limited. By sharing the clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 18 patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy, we hope to provide some references for obstetric treatment and management. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with COVID-19 treated at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, chest CT and pregnancy outcomes were performed for analysis. RESULTS: 1. 18 cases of late pregnancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were delivered at 35 + 5 weeks to 41 weeks. According to the clinical classification of COVID-19, 1 case was mild type, 16 cases were ordinary type, and 1 case was severe type. 2. According to imaging examinations: 15 (83%) cases showed unilateral or bilateral pneumonia, 2 (11%) cases had pulmonary infection with pleural effusion, and 1 (6%) case had no abnormal imaging changes. 8 (44%) cases were positive and 10 (56%) cases were negative for nasopharyngeal-swab tests of SARS-CoV-2. 3. Among the 18 newborns, there were 3 (17%) premature infants, 1 (6%) case of mild asphyxia, 5 (28%) cases of bacterial pneumonia, 1 (6%) case of gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 (6%) case of necrotizing enteritis, 2 (11%) cases of hyperbilirubinemia and 1 (6%) case of diarrhea.

We conducted a systematic review of articles referenced in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR) from December 20, 2019 to April 6, 2020, providing information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, and tears. We excluded ongoing clinical studies as for unobtainable conclusive results. Of 2422 articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria for analysis and were included in the study. None of the studies were multinational. Among the 11 selected papers there were three original articles, one review, four letters, two editorials, and one correspondence letter. Globally, 252 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were included in our review. The prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis complicating the course of COVID-19 was demonstrated to be as high as 32% in one study only. Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR. The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial. However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures. SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients' conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.

METHODS: Sixty-six older persons longitudinally followed as part of an aging study were included for having an autopsy and >1 MRI scan  with last MRI scan within 36 months of death. Mixed-effects models were used to examine the associations between longitudinal WMH accumulation and the following neuropathologic measures: myelin pallor  arteriolosclerosis  microvascular disease  microinfarcts  lacunar infarcts  large-vessel infarcts  atherosclerosis  neurofibrillary tangle rating  and neuritic plaque score. Each measure was included one at a time in the model  adjusted for duration of follow-up and age at death. A final model included measures showing an association with p < 0.1. RESULTS: Mean age at death was 94.5 years (5.5 SD). In the final mixed-effects models  arteriolosclerosis  myelin pallor  and Braak score remained significantly associated with increased WMH accumulation over time. In post hoc analysis  we found that those with Braak score 5 or 6 were more likely to also have high atherosclerosis present compared with those with Braak score 1 or 2 (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Accumulating white matter changes in advanced age are likely driven by small-vessel ischemic disease. Additionally  these results suggest a link between AD pathology and white matter integrity disruption. This may be due to wallerian degeneration secondary to neurodegenerative changes. Alternatively  a shared mechanism  for example ischemia  may lead to both vascular brain injury and neurodegenerative changes of AD. The observed correlation between atherosclerosis and AD pathology supports the latter.',\n",

Abruptly 19 days later after TAVI  she was transported to our hospital because of high fever and clouding of consciousness by ambulance. Head computed tomography demonstrated hemorrhage in her subarachnoid space. Relevant Test Results Prior to Catheterization: Primary trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) before TAVI demonstrated calcified degenerative stenotic change of aortic valve and mitral annular calcification (MAC).

The heart-to-mediastinum ratio (H/M) in PD and DLB is significantly lower than that in Parkinson's plus syndromes and Alzheimer's disease. Although this ratio is useful for distinguishing LBD from non-LBD  it fluctuates depending on the system performance of the gamma cameras. Therefore  a new  simple quantification method using (123)I-MIBG uptake analysis is required for clinical study. The purpose of this study was to develop a new uptake index with a simple protocol to determine (123)I-MIBG uptake on planar images. METHODS The (123)I-MIBG input function was obtained from the input counts of the pulmonary artery (PA)  which were assessed by analyzing the PA time-activity curves. The heart region of interest used for determining the H/M was used for calculating the uptake index  which was obtained by dividing the heart count by the input count. RESULTS Forty-eight patients underwent (123)I-MIBG chest angiography and planar imaging  after clinical feature assessment and tracer injection. The H/M and (123)I-MIBG uptake index were calculated and correlated with clinical features. Values for LBD were significantly lower than those for non-LBD in all analyses (P<0.001). The overlapping ranges between non-LBD and LBD were 2.15 to 2.49 in the H/M method  and 1.04 to 1.22% in the uptake index method. The diagnostic accuracy of the uptake index (area under the curve (AUC)  0.98; sensitivity  96%; specificity  91%; positive predictive value (PPV)  90%; negative predictive value (NPV)  93%; and accuracy  92%) was approximately equal to that of the H/M (AUC  0.95; sensitivity  93%; specificity  91%; PPV  90%; NPV  93%; and accuracy  92%) for discriminating patients with LBD and non-LBD. CONCLUSION A simple uptake index method was developed using (123)I-MIBG planar imaging and the input counts determined by analyzing chest radioisotope angiography images of the PA.

Methods - Presurgical evaluation was performed in 23 patients  who were considered candidates for temporal lobe resective surgery (14 females and nine males with a median age of 34 (range 13 to 50) years).The presurgical diagnosis was based on seizure semiology as demonstrated with ictal video recording  ictal and interictal scalp EEG recordings  and MRI. Results - Eighteen patients had convergent findings in clinical semiology  interictal and ictal EEG with scalp and sphenoidal electrodes  and MRI that warranted surgery without depth EEG (DEEG). In five patients with insufficient precision of localisation  DEEG with intracerebral and subdural electrodes was performed. MRI showed abnormalities in 22 out of 23 patients. Of these 22  18 had mesial temporal sclerosis. This was limited to the mesial temporal lobe in four and more widespread in the temporal lobe in 14 patients. In one patient only enlargement of the temporal horn was found and in three others only white matter lesions were detected. 18FDG PET showed a large area of glucose hypometabolism in the epileptogenic temporal lobe  with an extension outside the temporal lobe in 10 of 23 patients. Only in one of these patients DEEG showed extratemporal abnormalities that were concordant with a significant extratemporal extension of hypometabolism in 18FDG PET. 18FDG PET was compared with the results of scalp EEG: in none of the patients was an anterior temporal ictal onset in scalp EEG related to a maximum hypometabolism in the mesial temporal area. By contrast  the region of abnormality indicated by 11C-flumazenil PET was much more restricted  also when compared with DEEG findings. Extension of abnormality outside the lobe of surgery was seen in only two patients with 11C-flumazenil and was less pronounced compared with the intratemporal abnormality. Both 18FDG PET and 11C-flumazenil PET reliably indicated the epileptogenic temporal lobe. Thus these techniques provide valuable support for the presurgical diagnosis  especially in patients with non-lesional MRI or non-lateralising or localising scalp EEG recordings. In those patients in whom phase 1 presurgical evaluation on the basis of classic methods does not allow a localisation of the epileptogenic area  PET studies may provide valuable information for the strategy of the implantation of intracranial electrodes for DEEG. Previous studies have suggested that 11C-fiumazenil binding has a closer spatial relationship with the zone of ictal onset than the area of glucose hypometabolism  but this study suggests rather that the decrease in the 11C-flumazenil binding simply reflects a loss of neurons expressing the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor. 11C-flumazenil PET did not prove to be superior to 18FDG PET. Conclusion - In 21 patients sufficient material was obtained at surgery for a pathological examination. In 17 mesial temporal sclerosis  in one an oligodendroglioma grade B  in another a vascular malformation and in two patients no abnormalities were found. Although all 21 patients with pathological abnormality showed hypometabolic zones with 18FDG PET and a decreased uptake in 11C-flumazenil binding  there was no strong correlation between pathological diagnosis and functional abnormal areas in PET. Grading of medial temporal sclerosis according to the Wyler criteria showed no correlation with the degree of hypometabolism in either 18FDG or 11C-flumazenil PET. The interictal 123I-iomazenil SPECT technique was highly inaccurate in localising the lobe of surgery',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"An epigenetic blockade of cognitive functions in the neurodegenerating brain.Cognitive decline is a debilitating feature of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system  including Alzheimer's disease. The causes leading to such impairment are only poorly understood and effective treatments are slow to emerge. Here we show that cognitive capacities in the neurodegenerating brain are constrained by an epigenetic blockade of gene transcription that is potentially reversible. This blockade is mediated by histone deacetylase 2  which is increased by Alzheimer's-disease-related neurotoxic insults in vitro  in two mouse models of neurodegeneration and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Histone deacetylase 2 associates with and reduces the histone acetylation of genes important for learning and memory  which show a concomitant decrease in expression. Importantly  reversing the build-up of histone deacetylase 2 by short-hairpin-RNA-mediated knockdown unlocks the repression of these genes  reinstates structural and synaptic plasticity  and abolishes neurodegeneration-associated memory impairments. These findings advocate for the development of selective inhibitors of histone deacetylase 2 and suggest that cognitive capacities following neurodegeneration are not entirely lost  but merely impaired by this epigenetic blockade.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Examination of four 123I-labeled piperidine-based sigma receptor ligands as potential melanoma imaging agents: initial studies in mouse tumor modelsThe development of sigma (sigma) receptor radioligands has become the focus of research over the past few years due to their potential uses in nuclear medicine. It has been shown that a wide variety of human tumor cell lines express sigma receptors  including malignant melanoma and tumors of the colon  lung  brain  breast and testes. To provide potential probes for the in vivo SPECT examination of sigma receptor densities  we have synthesized a series of halogenated 4-(phenoxymethyl)piperidines and related compounds as high affinity sigma receptor ligands. Four of these have been labeled with I-123 and evaluated in vivo in mouse tumor models. All four radioligands were synthesized no-carrier-added using oxidative radioiododestannylation methods and specific activities > 74 000 MBq/mumol were obtained. Radiochemical yields were 55-83% EOS and radiochemical purities were > 98%. All four tracers were initially screened in vivo using distribution studies in nude mice with B16 melanoma tumors (8-12 mm diameter in the flank). In all four studies  high uptake (up to 0.90 +/- 0.42 %ID  12.99 +/- 4.28 %ID/g at 48 h) and excellent retention of radioactivity in tumor tissues was exhibited for as long as 48 h post-injection (PI). In the B16 melanoma model  the most promising results were obtained with [123I]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-(iodophenoxymethyl)piperidine (123I-3)  for which tumor/tissue ratios were significantly > 1.0 by 4 h PI for most organs and increased thereafter. Tumor/tissue ratios at 48 h were as follows: blood  68.4; muscle 31.7; brain  7.4; lung  6.3; liver  1.3. In subsequent studies  123I-3 was evaluated in nude mice with A375 human malignant melanoma. As in the B16 model  high uptake and prolonged retention of radioactivity in tumor tissues was noted. These results indicate that 123I-3 shows promise as a SPECT ligand for the detection of malignant melanoma',\n",

       "  {'feature': \"Microglial pathology in Down syndrome.Subjects with Down syndrome (DS) inevitably develop histopathological features pathognomonic of Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and DS can therefore be considered a human model of AD. Similar to AD  microglial activation has been reported in DS and the idea that detrimental neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is firmly embedded. However  recent work from this laboratory has offered evidence for an alternative view regarding the role of microglial cells in AD pathogenesis by showing presence of dystrophic (senescent) rather than activated microglia in both the AD and DS brain. In this report  we build on previously published observations in human brain and offer a detailed analysis of microglial senescent pathology in the temporal cortices of 6 DS cases in their 40s  a critical age bracket where virtually all DS subjects acquire neurofibrillary degeneration characteristic of AD. Our findings using both Iba1 and anti-ferritin immunostaining of microglial cells show that coincident with the appearance of tau pathology in DS subjects there is consistent presence of dystrophic microglial cells and conspicuous absence of activated microglia using both markers. The extent of microglial pathology varied among the individual DS cases  but they all revealed decreased numbers of normal microglia ranging from 19 to 85% of the controls. Nearly all of the ferritin-positive microglia  which constitute a subset of the total Iba1-reactive microglial population  exhibited dystrophic morphology. In its most severe form dystrophy was evident as total fragmentation of the cells' cytoplasm (cytorrhexis)  which likely reflects terminal degeneration of microglia. Severely dystrophic  ferritin-positive cells were often found to be colocalized with tau-positive senile plaques. Our findings help to consolidate the idea that microglial degeneration and neurofibrillary degeneration are closely linked events in a human model of AD. They suggest that microglial degeneration follows a gradually progressive course that increases in its severity in parallel with the progression of AD neurodegenerative changes.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Evaluation of bacterial co-infections of the respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUBACKGROUND: COVID-19 is known as a new viral infection. Viral-bacterial co-infections are one of the biggest medical concerns, resulting in increased mortality rates. To date, few studies have investigated bacterial superinfections in COVID-19 patients. Hence, we designed the current study on COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs. METHODS: Nineteen patients admitted to our ICUs were enrolled in this study. To detect COVID-19, reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed. Endotracheal aspirate samples were also collected and cultured on different media to support the growth of the bacteria. After incubation, formed colonies on the media were identified using Gram staining and other biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out based on the CLSI recommendations. RESULTS: Of nineteen COVID-19 patients, 11 (58%) patients were male and 8 (42%) were female, with a mean age of ~ 67 years old. The average ICU length of stay was ~ 15 days and at the end of the study, 18 cases (95%) expired and only was 1 case (5%) discharged. In total, all patients were found positive for bacterial infections, including seventeen Acinetobacter baumannii (90%) and two Staphylococcus aureus (10%) strains. There was no difference in the bacteria species detected in any of the sampling points. Seventeen of 17 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to the evaluated antibiotics. No metallo-beta-lactamases -producing Acinetobacter baumannii strain was found. One of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates was detected as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and isolated from the patient who died, while another Staphylococcus aureus strain was susceptible to tested drugs and identified as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the concern of superinfection in COVID-19 patients due to Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus. Consequently, it is important to pay attention to bacterial co-infections in critical patients positive for COVID-19.',\n",

Tau undergoes alternative splicing which generates six isoforms in the human brain  due to inclusion/exclusion of exons 2  3 and 10. Dysregulation of the splicing process of tau exon 10 is sufficient to cause tauopathy and has shown to be influenced by beta-amyloid peptides  but splicing of other exons is less studied. We studied the effects of beta-amyloid(42) in the alternative splicing of tau exons 2/3 and 6  using untreated and Nerve Growth Factor-induced PC12 cells. Beta-amyloid exposure caused formed cell processes to retract in differentiated cells and altered the expression of exons 2/3 in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Expression of exon 6 was repressed in undifferentiated cells only. Our results suggest that beta-amyloid interferes with the splicing process of exons 2/3  favoring their exclusion and thus the expression of immature tau isoforms that are less efficient in stabilizing microtubules and may also be more prone to hyperphosphorylation. The molecular mechanism for this amyloid-tau interaction remains to be determined  but may have potential implications for the understanding of the underlying neuropathological processes in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Frontotemporoparietal asymmetry and lack of illness awareness in schizophrenia.INTRODUCTION: Lack of illness awareness or anosognosia occurs in both schizophrenia and right hemisphere lesions due to stroke  dementia  and traumatic brain injury. In the latter conditions  anosognosia is thought to arise from unilateral hemispheric dysfunction or interhemispheric disequilibrium  which provides an anatomical model for exploring illness unawareness in other neuropsychiatric disorders  such as schizophrenia. METHODS: Both voxel-based morphometry using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) and a deformation-based morphology analysis of hemispheric asymmetry were performed on 52 treated schizophrenia subjects  exploring the relationship between illness awareness and gray matter volume. Analyses included age  gender  and total intracranial volume as covariates. RESULTS: Hemispheric asymmetry analyses revealed illness unawareness was significantly associated with right < left hemisphere volumes in the anteroinferior temporal lobe (t = 4.83  P = 0.051) using DARTEL  and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (t = 5.80  P = 0.003) and parietal lobe (t = 4.3  P = 0.050) using the deformation-based approach. Trend level associations were identified in the right medial prefrontal cortex (t = 4.49  P = 0.127) using DARTEL. Lack of illness awareness was also strongly associated with reduced total white matter volume (r = 0.401  P < 0.01) and illness severity (r = 0.559  P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a relationship between anosognosia and hemispheric asymmetry in schizophrenia  supporting previous volume-based MRI studies in schizophrenia that found a relationship between illness unawareness and reduced right hemisphere gray matter volume. Functional imaging studies are required to examine the neural mechanisms contributing to these structural observations.',\n",

Telemedicine is increasingly recognized as an attractive tool to alleviate resource strains. Herein we describe the rapid implementation and sequential process improvement (PI) of a centralized telehospitalist service to coordinate and optimize management of large number of COVID-19 patients in a tertiary and quaternary care hospital very close to the New York City epicenter. Methods: Prospective multidisciplinary PI meetings were held weekly between March 23 and May 10, 2020, and consensus service modifications were implemented for the following week. Inpatient census data, telehospitalist intervention volumes, and service utilization statistics were collected. Results/Discussion: Between March 23 and May 10, 2020, a total of 745 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the general medical wards. The telehospitalist service performed 1,136 audiovisual (AV) patient assessments, 379 best practice interventions, cohorted 108 patients, and conducted 170 remote family conversations. During the consecutive PI cycles, a number of adaptations in AV setup, care standardization, patient logistics, communication, and consultative functions were made to load balance the bedside hospitalist teams. As the COVID-19 hospital census increased to peak levels, the most value was added through facilitation of communication and collaboration between the bedside clinical teams, the infection prevention and control teams, and patient logistics team. Conclusions: A telehospitalist service can be rapidly implemented with basic telemedicine equipment. Processes/this functions can be sequentially adapted to quickly changing needs during conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic that very quickly can place extraordinary strains on hospital resources.',\n",

In contrast, point of care ultrasound (POCUS), performed by a gastroenterologist in the IBD clinic, provides immediate, cheap, and convenient imaging. Preliminary data suggest good accuracy, but confirmation is required. We hypothesised that POCUS provides accurate and clinically useful information in patients with Crohn's disease. Methods: Disease activity, disease extent and the presence of complications [entero-enteric fistula and extra mural complication (abscess)] were assessed by POCUS, MRE and ileo-colonoscopy. At a single-centre, a single-gastroenterologist conducted POCUS scans within three months of either MRE or ileo-colonoscopy without intervening change in medical therapy. The gastroenterologist had performed 200 previous supervised scans in patients with IBD at a high volume intestinal ultrasound centre (Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Canada), a training level regarded as the minimum required to achieve independent competence. The accuracy of POCUS was analysed with respect to both MRE and ileo-colonoscopy and its agreement with these modalities assessed using kappa coefficient. Results: 43 patients (49% males) with confirmed Crohn's disease had a POCUS that was paired with MRE and 38 patients (47% males) had a POCUS paired with ileo-colonoscopy. When compared with ileo-colonoscopy POCUS was accurate in the assessment of disease activity (sensitivity 72%, specificity 86%, ROC 0.79) and extent (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 86%, ROC 0.86). No analysis was made for POCUS in relation to lleo-colonoscopy for the accuracy of diagnosing complications due to the low number of patients with complications diagnosed at ileo-colonoscopy. For POCUS and ileo-colonoscopy kappa estimates were 0.55 (95% CI 0.30-0.80) p < 0.001 for disease activity and 0.62 (95% CI 0.32-0.92) p < 0.001 for disease extent. When compared with MRE, POCUS was accurate in the assessment of disease activity (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 61.1%, ROC 0.74), extent (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 83.3%, ROC 0.81) and complications (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 94.3%, ROC 0.90). Agreement between POCUS and MRE was good (kappa estimates 0.50 (95% CI 0.24-0.76) p < 0.001, 0.61 (95% CI 0.37-0.85) p < 0.001 and 0.76 (95% CI 0.50-1.00) p < 0.001) for disease activity, extent and complications respectively.

METHODS: The local ethics committee approved this retrospective study and waived the need of informed consent. From March 9 to April 10, 2020, all patients referred to our institution for a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 with moderate to severe symptoms underwent a chest CT for triage. Patients with a/parenchymal lesion characteristics of COVID-19 involving at least 50% of lung parenchyma and b/positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively included. Adrenal glands were reviewed by two independent readers to look for AAI. Additional demographics and potential biological markers of adrenal insufficiency were obtained. Correlations with ICU stay and mortality were sought. RESULTS: Out of the 219 patients with critical (n = 52) and severe lung (n = 167) parenchyma lesions, 51 (23%) had CT scan signs of AAI, which was bilateral in 45 patients (88%). Four patients had an acute biological adrenal gland insufficiency (8%).

This selective review highlights the immunological  neuroendocrinological  molecular biological and neuroimaging abnormalities characteristic of BD  with a focus on those likely to reflect trait abnormalities by virtue of their presence in euthymic patients or in unaffected relatives of patients at high genetic liability for illness. Trait neurobiological abnormalities of BD include heightened pro-inflammatory function and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. Dysfunction in the intracellular signal transduction pathway is indicated by elevated protein kinase A activity and altered intracellular calcium signalling. Consistent neuroimaging abnormalities include the presence of ventricular enlargement and white matter abnormalities in patients with BD  which may represent intermediate phenotypes of illness. In addition  spectroscopy studies indicate reduced prefrontal cerebral N-acetylaspartate and phosphomonoester concentrations. Functional neuroimaging studies of euthymic patients implicate inherently impaired neural networks subserving emotional regulation  including anterior limbic  ventral and dorsal prefrontal regions. Despite heterogeneous samples and conflicting findings pervading the literature  there is accumulating evidence for the existence of neurobiological trait abnormalities in BD at various scales of investigation.

Most currently available imaging techniques are inaccurate for detecting transmural extension  perienteric spread of tumors and distant lymph node involvement. Although both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have an unacceptably low sensitivity for accurate staging  CT is clearly superior to MRI for detecting extrahepatic metastases.

The diagnostic efficacy of MRI and intravenous dynamic hepatic CT for detecting liver metastases is approximately equal. CT during arterial portography is recommended before resection of solitary liver metastases. Chest radiography is also part of the routine preoperative evaluation.

Both memapsin 2 and APP are transported from the cell surface to endosomes where APP is cleaved by memapsin 2. We described previously that the cytosolic domain of memapsin 2 contains an acid cluster-dileucine motif (ACDL) that binds the VHS (Vps-27  Hrs  and STAM) domain of Golgi-localized gamma-ear-containing ARF-binding (GGA) proteins (He  X.

Depleting cellular GGA proteins with RNA interference or mutation of serine 498 to stop the phosphorylation of ACDL resulted in the accumulation of memapsin 2 in early endosomes. A similar change of memapsin 2 localization also was observed when a retromer subunit  VPS26  was depleted.

The ongoing outbreak of this respiratory disease has posed critical challenges to public health, research, and medical communities around the world. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with lung cancer in the People's Republic of China. Methods: We collected data on 397 inpatients from a single center during 4 weeks of the pandemic (2020 group) and that of 2504 inpatients during the same period (4 wk) in the past 5 years (2015-2019 group). A questionnaire was used to investigate the medical demands of 803 patients with lung cancer at 65 hospitals in 20 provinces in the People's Republic of China during the pandemic. We evaluated the incidence data of COVID-19 in Guangdong to analyze the tendency of the pandemic and compared it with inpatient data. Results: The number of hospitalizations and lung cancer-related operations had steadily increased from 2015 to 2019 but reduced by an average of 26.72% (133.8) and 57.18% (45.4) in 2020. The hospital capacity decreased by 28.00% (35 inpatient beds) during the pandemic period of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The pandemic caused a greater impact on medical work related to lung cancer after the Chinese New Year holiday. Patients were most concerned about long waiting times for outpatient services, inpatient beds, physical examinations, or operations (406; 50.56%); the possibility of infection with the novel coronavirus (359; 44.71%); and the difficulties in getting to a hospital owing to transportation outages (279; 34.74%). Patients in stage I and II revealed having less fear about disease progression (14 [18.18%] and four [14.81%], respectively), had lower proportions of delayed medical arrangement (15 [19.48%] and six [22.22%], respectively), and complained less about complex treatment procedures (12 [15.58%] and five [18.52%], respectively). Patients in the high-infected area (345, 56.74%) complained more frequently about longer booking periods than those in the low-infected area (61, 31.28%). Conclusions: The treatment of patients with lung cancer has been affected by the pandemic to some extent. We provide suggestions on both clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies for lung cancer to optimize the process, given the urgency of the current circumstances. The demand for medical support among patients with lung cancer or other life-threatening diseases should be given sufficient attention, especially during the current COVID-19 outbreak.

However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control, it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are significantly increased if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. With all related control measures maintained at their baseline levels, this study shows that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods (mention what happens if lockdown measures were extended by two weeks). We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are at the baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the community lockdown measures were lifted at the mild lifting level (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the levels of these activities allowed during the corresponding lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. It is further shown that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Results from the ERA-EDTA Registry indicate a high mortality due to COVID-19 in dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients across EuropeThe aim of this study was to investigate 28-day mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis in the European kidney replacement therapy population. In addition, we determined the role of patient characteristics, treatment factors, and country on mortality risk using ERA-EDTA Registry data on patients receiving kidney replacement therapy in Europe between February 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Additional data on all patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were collected from seven European countries encompassing 4298 patients. COVID-19 attributable mortality was calculated using propensity-score matched historic controls and after 28 days of follow-up was 20.0% (95% confidence interval 18.7%-21.4%) in 3285 patients receiving dialysis, and 19.9% (17.5%-22.5%) in 1013 recipients of a transplant. We identified differences in COVID-19 mortality across countries, and an increased mortality risk in older patients receiving kidney replacement therapy and male patients receiving dialysis. In recipients of kidney transplants older than 75 years of age 44.3% (35.7%-53.9%) did not survive COVID-19. Mortality risk was 1.28 (1.02-1.60) times higher in transplant recipients compared with matched dialysis patients. Thus, the pandemic has had a substantial effect on mortality in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy; a highly vulnerable population due to underlying chronic kidney disease and high prevalence of multimorbidity.

       "  {'feature': 'Predictive Value of Sudden Olfactory Loss in the Diagnosis of COVID-19INTRODUCTION: Recent reports suggest that sudden smell loss might be a symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an outpatient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom \"sudden smell loss\" for screening procedures. METHODS: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients\\' main symptoms, time course, and an additional self-assessment of the patients\\' current smell, taste function, and nasal breathing compared to the level before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 12 out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom \"sudden smell loss\" in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom \"sudden smell loss\" can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a positive predictive value of 63% and negative predictive value of 97% for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease and should be tested for on a regular basis. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19-associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose. Copyright Â© 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'The association of voter turnout with county-level coronavirus disease 2019 occurrence early in the pandemicPurpose: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely impacted both health and the economy. Absent an effective vaccine, preventive measures used, some of which are being relaxed, have included school closures, restriction of movement, and banning of large gatherings. Our goal was to estimate the association of voter turnout with county-level COVID-19 risks. Method(s): We used publicly available data on voter turnout in the March 10 primary in three states, COVID-19 confirmed cases by day and county, and county-level census data. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to estimate the association of voter turnout with COVID-19 incidence, adjusted for county-level population density and proportions: over age 65 years, female, Black, with college education, with high school education, poor, obese, and smokers. Result(s): COVID-19 risk was associated with voter turnout, most strongly in Michigan during the week starting 3 days postelection (risk ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.33). For longer periods, the association was progressively weaker (risk ratio 0.98-1.03). Conclusion(s): Despite increased absentee-ballot voting in the primary, our results suggest an association of voter turnout in at least one state with a detectable increase in risks associated with and perhaps due to greater exposures related to the primary.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'Association of Comorbidities With Pneumonia and Death Among COVID-19 Patients in Mexico: A Nationwide Cross-sectional StudyOBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to identify chronic conditions and multimorbidity patterns in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to examine their associations with pneumonia and death. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed the official data of COVID-19 patients in Mexico through May 18, 2020 (released by the Secretaria de Salud de Mexico). Adjusted logistic regression models were applied to assess the associations of comorbidities with pneumonia and death. The marginal effects were estimated, and the probability of pneumonia or death according to the number of comorbidities was graphed for each year of age. RESULTS: Of the 51 053 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the final analysis, 27 667 (54.2%) had no chronic conditions, while 13 652 (26.7%), 6518 (12.8%) and 3216 (6.3%) were reported to have 1, 2, and 3 or more simultaneous conditions, respectively. Overall, a significant incremental gradient was observed for the association between multimorbidity and pneumonia (p<0.001); for 2 chronic conditions, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.95 to 2.20), and for >=3 conditions, the aOR was 2.40 (95% CI, 2.22 to 2.60). A significant incremental gradient was also found for the relationship between multimorbidity and death (p<0.001); an aOR of 2.51 (95% CI, 2.30 to 2.73) was found for 2 chronic conditions and an aOR of 3.49 (95% CI, 3.15 to 3.86) for >=3 conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying chronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with pneumonia and death in Mexican COVID-19 patients. Future investigation is necessary to clarify the pathophysiological processes behind this association, given the high burden of chronic diseases in various countries, including Mexico.',\n",

       "  {'feature': 'SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in an asymptomatic cancer cohort - results and consequences for clinical routineBACKGROUND: Starting in December 2019, the current pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confronts the world with an unprecedented challenge. With no vaccine or drug being currently available to control the pandemic spread, prevention and PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) testing becomes a crucial pillar of medical systems. Aim of the present study was to report on the first results of the measures taken in a large German Department of Radiation Oncology, including PCR testing of asymptomatic cancer patients. METHODS: Pandemic-adapted hygiene regulations and prevention measures for patients and staff were implemented. A visiting ban on both wards was implemented from the beginning and medical staff and patients were required to wear face masks at all times. The waiting rooms were rearranged to ensure distance between patients of at least 1.5 m. Clinical follow up was mainly done by telephone and all patients had to complete a questionnaire regarding symptoms and contacts with COVID-19 patients before entering our department. Educational documents were created for patients to raise awareness of symptoms and avoidance strategies for interactions with other people. Indications for therapy and fractionation schemes were adapted when possible. In a subsequent step, all new asymptomatic patients were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at our screening station shortly before their simulation CT. RESULTS: All these measures and implementations have been well accepted semiquantitatively measured by the consent received from patients and staff. Regarding the PCR testing, only 1 out of 139 asymptomatic patients of our cohort so far tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, reflecting a prevalence of 0.72% in this cancer patient population. Up to this point no staff members was tested positive. The start of the treatment for the PCR-positive patient was deferred for 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Due to the pandemic-adapted implementations, our department seems well prepared during this crisis. The initial screening helps to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in order to protect other patients and our staff from infection and the observed PCR prevalence is in line with comparable studies. A regular PCR testing (e.g. twice a week) of all patients and staff would in principle be desirable but is limited due to testing capacities at present.',\n",

       "      <td>The objective of the paper is to analyse changes in food commodity prices and estimate the potential effects of food price change on nutrition security in Nepal in the context of COVID-19 contagion control measures. It presents a comparative intra-country observational study design looking at events before and during the pandemic (after implementation of contagion control measures). The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agroecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the 'Post COVID 19' reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the 'Pre COVID 19' reference point. The study finds substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9.5% for zinc to 11% for vitamin A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37% followed by iron at 19%, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals. COVID-19 control measures are likely to have contributed to substantial price inflation over the reference period with potentially damaging effects on nutrition security in Nepal with serious implications for vulnerable populations.Copyright Â© 2020 Cambridge University Press.

       "      <td>[15O]-water PET was performed on 12 patients with structural lesions for localization of the motor (r\\ = 5)  language (receptive and expressive; n = 6)  and visual cortex (h = 1). All these patients underwent interactive image-guided surgery using an infrared digitizer and intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping for motor  sensory  language  and visual cortex location. MRI-PET coregistration was performed using a surface matching approach that integrated functional information with interactive image guidance during the surgical procedure. An awake craniotomy with motor and sensory intraoperative stimulation was performed using a registered bipolar electrode that was tracked on real-time during the surgical procedure. Intraoperative functional findings were displayed and saved on the registered MRI images. The sites of functional PET activation during the performance of motor  visual and language tasks were then compared to the results of intraoperative cortical stimulation in /1 patients and visual evoked potentials in one. The results of the PET activation studies were concordant with the findings of intraoperative stimulation in all cases. During resection of the structural lesions  intraoperative stimulation was continued in the subcortical pathways  and five patients had positive responses on areas not identified by the functional PET. Furthermore  3 patients showed transitory changes in function (speech arrest 1  naming difficulty 1  and motor weakness 1) that were reversible after changing the dissection technique or a brain retractor. [1SO]water PET was reliable in identifying the motor  visual  and language cortex. Language-related rCBF increases were highly distributive  although only part of these activations were subjected to intraoperative stimulation. We conclude that [15O]-water PET can be used for preoperative noninvasive identification of functional cortex and may be useful in neurosurgical preplanning. Intraoperative mapping still remains the main means to avoid neurological damage as it can be performed during the entire surgical procedure to avoid damage to cortex  pathways  and damage secondary to ischemia or edema (brain retraction). ﾂｩ 1997 Forefront Publishing Group</td>\n",

We selected COVID-19 observational studies from eight countries, including, China, Italy, Australia, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19.

       "      <td>BACKGROUND: As the novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic occurred, no specific treatment was yet available. Inflammatory response secondary to viral infection might be the driver of severe diseases. We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262-0.952], p=0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088-2.524], p=0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events. DISCUSSION: TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events. FINANCIAL SUPPORT: Some of the tocilizumab doses used in the subjects included in this analysis were provided by the \"Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\" (EudraCT Number: 2020-001110-38) supported by the Italian National Agency for Drugs (AIFA).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with glioblastoma and three patients with low grade astrocytoma were studied with Tl-201 SPECT. Histololgic diagnosis was obtained in all patients by biopsy and all patients had CT scans within 2 weeks of the SPECT study. Seventeen patients were followed with one or more SPECT and CT evaluations. RESULTS: Single photon emission computerized tomography studies  after surgery  radiotherapy  and/or chemotherapy  were more accurate than CT in identifying progression or regression of disease. Twenty-three patients had evidence of disease and 11 patients had no evidence of recurrent disease in the initial Tl-201 SPECT study following therapy. Computerized tomography identified 20 of the 23 patients with disease and 6 of 11 patients with no recurrent disease. Follow-up with Tl-201 SPECT in 17 patients suggested progression of disease in 9 patients  while CT showed progression in only 3 patients. Clinical examinations and repeat CT studies confirmed the accuracy of Tl-201 SPECT images. CONCLUSION: We found Tl-201 SPECT more accurate than CT scans in a prospective evaluation of 34 patients with brain tumor.

It presents a comparative intra-country observational study design looking at events before and during the pandemic (after implementation of contagion control measures). The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agroecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the 'Post COVID 19' reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the 'Pre COVID 19' reference point. The study finds substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9.5% for zinc to 11% for vitamin A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37% followed by iron at 19%, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals.

       "27147  [15O]-water PET was performed on 12 patients with structural lesions for localization of the motor (r\\ = 5)  language (receptive and expressive; n = 6)  and visual cortex (h = 1). All these patients underwent interactive image-guided surgery using an infrared digitizer and intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping for motor  sensory  language  and visual cortex location. MRI-PET coregistration was performed using a surface matching approach that integrated functional information with interactive image guidance during the surgical procedure. An awake craniotomy with motor and sensory intraoperative stimulation was performed using a registered bipolar electrode that was tracked on real-time during the surgical procedure. Intraoperative functional findings were displayed and saved on the registered MRI images. The sites of functional PET activation during the performance of motor  visual and language tasks were then compared to the results of intraoperative cortical stimulation in /1 patients and visual evoked potentials in one. The results of the PET activation studies were concordant with the findings of intraoperative stimulation in all cases. During resection of the structural lesions  intraoperative stimulation was continued in the subcortical pathways  and five patients had positive responses on areas not identified by the functional PET. Furthermore  3 patients showed transitory changes in function (speech arrest 1  naming difficulty 1  and motor weakness 1) that were reversible after changing the dissection technique or a brain retractor. [1SO]water PET was reliable in identifying the motor  visual  and language cortex. Language-related rCBF increases were highly distributive  although only part of these activations were subjected to intraoperative stimulation. We conclude that [15O]-water PET can be used for preoperative noninvasive identification of functional cortex and may be useful in neurosurgical preplanning. Intraoperative mapping still remains the main means to avoid neurological damage as it can be performed during the entire surgical procedure to avoid damage to cortex  pathways  and damage secondary to ischemia or edema (brain retraction). ﾂｩ 1997 Forefront Publishing Group   \n",

Edge operators are used to identify tissue interfaces and thereby more realistically model tissue label dependencies between adjacent voxels on opposite sides of an interface. When applied to a synthetic MRI template corrupted by additive noise  it provided more consistent tissue labeling across noise levels than two commonly used methods (FAST and SPM5). When applied to longitudinal MRI series it provided lesser variability in individual trajectories of tissue change  suggesting superior ability to discriminate real tissue change from noise. These results suggest that this method may be useful for robust longitudinal brain tissue change estimation.   \n",

We selected COVID-19 observational studies from eight countries, including, China, Italy, Australia, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19.

HCPs are at high risk of not only contracting the infection but also spreading it unknowingly. It is of utmost importance to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) and the ability to assess the risks associated with the outbreak. A cross-sectional online survey involving physicians, pharmacists, and nurses was conducted. A 39-itemed questionnaire based on the World Health Organization (WHO)COVID-19 risk assessment tool was shared with healthcare professionals in three purposively selected key divisions of Punjab province. Out of 500 healthcare professionals, 385 responded to the survey. The majority (70%) were aged 22-29 years; 144 (37.4%) physicians, 113 (29.4%) nurses, and 128 (33.2%) pharmacists completed the survey. Overall, 94.8% of healthcare professionals scored adequately (>14) for COVID-19-related knowledge; 97.9% displayed an optimistic attitude (>42) and 94.5% had an adequate practice score (>28). Kruskal-Wallis and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in KAP and risk assessment scores among groups; physicians and nurses scored higher as compared to pharmacists. Further research and follow-up investigations on disaster management and risk assessment can help policy-makers better tackle future epidemics.   \n",

Inflammatory response secondary to viral infection might be the driver of severe diseases. We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262-0.952], p=0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088-2.524], p=0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events. DISCUSSION: TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events. FINANCIAL SUPPORT: Some of the tocilizumab doses used in the subjects included in this analysis were provided by the \"Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\" (EudraCT Number: 2020-001110-38) supported by the Italian National Agency for Drugs (AIFA).

This study was undertaken to evaluate PET in the detection of head and neck malignancies  and to determine its effectiveness in diagnosing recurrent cancer in operated or irradiated fields. PET revealed that each biopsy-proven tumour is an area of increased radioactivity. Tumour radioactivity ranged from 130% to 300% above that of the cerebellum  and up to 650% above the contralateral  normal side. By basing the maps on tissue metabolic function  PET proved capable of distinguishing tumour (increased radioactivity) from scar tissue (reduced radioactivity).

Thallium-201 has been shown to concentrate in viable tumor  and Tl-201 single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging can identify tumor burden more accurately than CT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with glioblastoma and three patients with low grade astrocytoma were studied with Tl-201 SPECT. Histololgic diagnosis was obtained in all patients by biopsy and all patients had CT scans within 2 weeks of the SPECT study. Seventeen patients were followed with one or more SPECT and CT evaluations. RESULTS: Single photon emission computerized tomography studies  after surgery  radiotherapy  and/or chemotherapy  were more accurate than CT in identifying progression or regression of disease. Twenty-three patients had evidence of disease and 11 patients had no evidence of recurrent disease in the initial Tl-201 SPECT study following therapy. Computerized tomography identified 20 of the 23 patients with disease and 6 of 11 patients with no recurrent disease. Follow-up with Tl-201 SPECT in 17 patients suggested progression of disease in 9 patients  while CT showed progression in only 3 patients. Clinical examinations and repeat CT studies confirmed the accuracy of Tl-201 SPECT images. CONCLUSION: We found Tl-201 SPECT more accurate than CT scans in a prospective evaluation of 34 patients with brain tumor. Follow-up studies with both Tl-201 SPECT and CT imaging in 17 patients demonstrated that SPECT was more reliable than CT in identifying progression  improvement  or no change in brain tumor burden   \n",

It presents a comparative intra-country observational study design looking at events before and during the pandemic (after implementation of contagion control measures). The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agroecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the 'Post COVID 19' reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the 'Pre COVID 19' reference point. The study finds substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9.5% for zinc to 11% for vitamin A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37% followed by iron at 19%, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals. COVID-19 control measures are likely to have contributed to substantial price inflation over the reference period with potentially damaging effects on nutrition security in Nepal with serious implications for vulnerable populations.Copyright Â© 2020 Cambridge University Press.

       "27147  [15O]-water PET was performed on 12 patients with structural lesions for localization of the motor (r\\ = 5)  language (receptive and expressive; n = 6)  and visual cortex (h = 1). All these patients underwent interactive image-guided surgery using an infrared digitizer and intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping for motor  sensory  language  and visual cortex location. MRI-PET coregistration was performed using a surface matching approach that integrated functional information with interactive image guidance during the surgical procedure. An awake craniotomy with motor and sensory intraoperative stimulation was performed using a registered bipolar electrode that was tracked on real-time during the surgical procedure. Intraoperative functional findings were displayed and saved on the registered MRI images. The sites of functional PET activation during the performance of motor  visual and language tasks were then compared to the results of intraoperative cortical stimulation in /1 patients and visual evoked potentials in one. The results of the PET activation studies were concordant with the findings of intraoperative stimulation in all cases. During resection of the structural lesions  intraoperative stimulation was continued in the subcortical pathways  and five patients had positive responses on areas not identified by the functional PET. Furthermore  3 patients showed transitory changes in function (speech arrest 1  naming difficulty 1  and motor weakness 1) that were reversible after changing the dissection technique or a brain retractor. [1SO]water PET was reliable in identifying the motor  visual  and language cortex. Language-related rCBF increases were highly distributive  although only part of these activations were subjected to intraoperative stimulation. We conclude that [15O]-water PET can be used for preoperative noninvasive identification of functional cortex and may be useful in neurosurgical preplanning. Intraoperative mapping still remains the main means to avoid neurological damage as it can be performed during the entire surgical procedure to avoid damage to cortex  pathways  and damage secondary to ischemia or edema (brain retraction). ﾂｩ 1997 Forefront Publishing Group  \n",

Edge operators are used to identify tissue interfaces and thereby more realistically model tissue label dependencies between adjacent voxels on opposite sides of an interface. When applied to a synthetic MRI template corrupted by additive noise  it provided more consistent tissue labeling across noise levels than two commonly used methods (FAST and SPM5). When applied to longitudinal MRI series it provided lesser variability in individual trajectories of tissue change  suggesting superior ability to discriminate real tissue change from noise. These results suggest that this method may be useful for robust longitudinal brain tissue change estimation.  \n",

We selected COVID-19 observational studies from eight countries, including, China, Italy, Australia, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19.

HCPs are at high risk of not only contracting the infection but also spreading it unknowingly. It is of utmost importance to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) and the ability to assess the risks associated with the outbreak. A cross-sectional online survey involving physicians, pharmacists, and nurses was conducted. A 39-itemed questionnaire based on the World Health Organization (WHO)COVID-19 risk assessment tool was shared with healthcare professionals in three purposively selected key divisions of Punjab province. Out of 500 healthcare professionals, 385 responded to the survey. The majority (70%) were aged 22-29 years; 144 (37.4%) physicians, 113 (29.4%) nurses, and 128 (33.2%) pharmacists completed the survey. Overall, 94.8% of healthcare professionals scored adequately (>14) for COVID-19-related knowledge; 97.9% displayed an optimistic attitude (>42) and 94.5% had an adequate practice score (>28). Kruskal-Wallis and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in KAP and risk assessment scores among groups; physicians and nurses scored higher as compared to pharmacists. Further research and follow-up investigations on disaster management and risk assessment can help policy-makers better tackle future epidemics.  \n",

Inflammatory response secondary to viral infection might be the driver of severe diseases. We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262-0.952], p=0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088-2.524], p=0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events. DISCUSSION: TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events. FINANCIAL SUPPORT: Some of the tocilizumab doses used in the subjects included in this analysis were provided by the \"Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\" (EudraCT Number: 2020-001110-38) supported by the Italian National Agency for Drugs (AIFA).

This study was undertaken to evaluate PET in the detection of head and neck malignancies  and to determine its effectiveness in diagnosing recurrent cancer in operated or irradiated fields. PET revealed that each biopsy-proven tumour is an area of increased radioactivity. Tumour radioactivity ranged from 130% to 300% above that of the cerebellum  and up to 650% above the contralateral  normal side. By basing the maps on tissue metabolic function  PET proved capable of distinguishing tumour (increased radioactivity) from scar tissue (reduced radioactivity). Its application may facilitate the diagnosis of recurrent tumours amid the fibrosis and distortion of normal architecture in operated  irradiated fields  \n",

Thallium-201 has been shown to concentrate in viable tumor  and Tl-201 single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging can identify tumor burden more accurately than CT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with glioblastoma and three patients with low grade astrocytoma were studied with Tl-201 SPECT. Histololgic diagnosis was obtained in all patients by biopsy and all patients had CT scans within 2 weeks of the SPECT study. Seventeen patients were followed with one or more SPECT and CT evaluations. RESULTS: Single photon emission computerized tomography studies  after surgery  radiotherapy  and/or chemotherapy  were more accurate than CT in identifying progression or regression of disease. Twenty-three patients had evidence of disease and 11 patients had no evidence of recurrent disease in the initial Tl-201 SPECT study following therapy. Computerized tomography identified 20 of the 23 patients with disease and 6 of 11 patients with no recurrent disease. Follow-up with Tl-201 SPECT in 17 patients suggested progression of disease in 9 patients  while CT showed progression in only 3 patients. Clinical examinations and repeat CT studies confirmed the accuracy of Tl-201 SPECT images. CONCLUSION: We found Tl-201 SPECT more accurate than CT scans in a prospective evaluation of 34 patients with brain tumor. Follow-up studies with both Tl-201 SPECT and CT imaging in 17 patients demonstrated that SPECT was more reliable than CT in identifying progression  improvement  or no change in brain tumor burden  \n",

It presents a comparative intra-country observational study design looking at events before and during the pandemic (after implementation of contagion control measures). The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agroecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the 'Post COVID 19' reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the 'Pre COVID 19' reference point. The study finds substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9.5% for zinc to 11% for vitamin A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37% followed by iron at 19%, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals. COVID-19 control measures are likely to have contributed to substantial price inflation over the reference period with potentially damaging effects on nutrition security in Nepal with serious implications for vulnerable populations.Copyright Â© 2020 Cambridge University Press.

All these patients underwent interactive image-guided surgery using an infrared digitizer and intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping for motor  sensory  language  and visual cortex location. MRI-PET coregistration was performed using a surface matching approach that integrated functional information with interactive image guidance during the surgical procedure. An awake craniotomy with motor and sensory intraoperative stimulation was performed using a registered bipolar electrode that was tracked on real-time during the surgical procedure. Intraoperative functional findings were displayed and saved on the registered MRI images. The sites of functional PET activation during the performance of motor  visual and language tasks were then compared to the results of intraoperative cortical stimulation in /1 patients and visual evoked potentials in one. The results of the PET activation studies were concordant with the findings of intraoperative stimulation in all cases. During resection of the structural lesions  intraoperative stimulation was continued in the subcortical pathways  and five patients had positive responses on areas not identified by the functional PET. Furthermore  3 patients showed transitory changes in function (speech arrest 1  naming difficulty 1  and motor weakness 1) that were reversible after changing the dissection technique or a brain retractor. [1SO]water PET was reliable in identifying the motor  visual  and language cortex. Language-related rCBF increases were highly distributive  although only part of these activations were subjected to intraoperative stimulation. We conclude that [15O]-water PET can be used for preoperative noninvasive identification of functional cortex and may be useful in neurosurgical preplanning. Intraoperative mapping still remains the main means to avoid neurological damage as it can be performed during the entire surgical procedure to avoid damage to cortex  pathways  and damage secondary to ischemia or edema (brain retraction). ﾂｩ 1997 Forefront Publishing Group</td>\n",

The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19.

It presents a comparative intra-country observational study design looking at events before and during the pandemic (after implementation of contagion control measures). The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agroecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the 'Post COVID 19' reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the 'Pre COVID 19' reference point. The study finds substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9.5% for zinc to 11% for vitamin A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37% followed by iron at 19%, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals. COVID-19 control measures are likely to have contributed to substantial price inflation over the reference period with potentially damaging effects on nutrition security in Nepal with serious implications for vulnerable populations.Copyright Â© 2020 Cambridge University Press.

       "27147  [15O]-water PET was performed on 12 patients with structural lesions for localization of the motor (r\\ = 5)  language (receptive and expressive; n = 6)  and visual cortex (h = 1). All these patients underwent interactive image-guided surgery using an infrared digitizer and intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping for motor  sensory  language  and visual cortex location. MRI-PET coregistration was performed using a surface matching approach that integrated functional information with interactive image guidance during the surgical procedure. An awake craniotomy with motor and sensory intraoperative stimulation was performed using a registered bipolar electrode that was tracked on real-time during the surgical procedure. Intraoperative functional findings were displayed and saved on the registered MRI images. The sites of functional PET activation during the performance of motor  visual and language tasks were then compared to the results of intraoperative cortical stimulation in /1 patients and visual evoked potentials in one. The results of the PET activation studies were concordant with the findings of intraoperative stimulation in all cases. During resection of the structural lesions  intraoperative stimulation was continued in the subcortical pathways  and five patients had positive responses on areas not identified by the functional PET. Furthermore  3 patients showed transitory changes in function (speech arrest 1  naming difficulty 1  and motor weakness 1) that were reversible after changing the dissection technique or a brain retractor. [1SO]water PET was reliable in identifying the motor  visual  and language cortex. Language-related rCBF increases were highly distributive  although only part of these activations were subjected to intraoperative stimulation. We conclude that [15O]-water PET can be used for preoperative noninvasive identification of functional cortex and may be useful in neurosurgical preplanning. Intraoperative mapping still remains the main means to avoid neurological damage as it can be performed during the entire surgical procedure to avoid damage to cortex  pathways  and damage secondary to ischemia or edema (brain retraction). ﾂｩ 1997 Forefront Publishing Group   \n",

Edge operators are used to identify tissue interfaces and thereby more realistically model tissue label dependencies between adjacent voxels on opposite sides of an interface. When applied to a synthetic MRI template corrupted by additive noise  it provided more consistent tissue labeling across noise levels than two commonly used methods (FAST and SPM5). When applied to longitudinal MRI series it provided lesser variability in individual trajectories of tissue change  suggesting superior ability to discriminate real tissue change from noise. These results suggest that this method may be useful for robust longitudinal brain tissue change estimation.   \n",

We selected COVID-19 observational studies from eight countries, including, China, Italy, Australia, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19.

It presents a comparative intra-country observational study design looking at events before and during the pandemic (after implementation of contagion control measures). The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agroecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the 'Post COVID 19' reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the 'Pre COVID 19' reference point. The study finds substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9.5% for zinc to 11% for vitamin A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37% followed by iron at 19%, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals. COVID-19 control measures are likely to have contributed to substantial price inflation over the reference period with potentially damaging effects on nutrition security in Nepal with serious implications for vulnerable populations.Copyright Â© 2020 Cambridge University Press.

       "27147  [15O]-water PET was performed on 12 patients with structural lesions for localization of the motor (r\\ = 5)  language (receptive and expressive; n = 6)  and visual cortex (h = 1). All these patients underwent interactive image-guided surgery using an infrared digitizer and intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping for motor  sensory  language  and visual cortex location. MRI-PET coregistration was performed using a surface matching approach that integrated functional information with interactive image guidance during the surgical procedure. An awake craniotomy with motor and sensory intraoperative stimulation was performed using a registered bipolar electrode that was tracked on real-time during the surgical procedure. Intraoperative functional findings were displayed and saved on the registered MRI images. The sites of functional PET activation during the performance of motor  visual and language tasks were then compared to the results of intraoperative cortical stimulation in /1 patients and visual evoked potentials in one. The results of the PET activation studies were concordant with the findings of intraoperative stimulation in all cases. During resection of the structural lesions  intraoperative stimulation was continued in the subcortical pathways  and five patients had positive responses on areas not identified by the functional PET. Furthermore  3 patients showed transitory changes in function (speech arrest 1  naming difficulty 1  and motor weakness 1) that were reversible after changing the dissection technique or a brain retractor. [1SO]water PET was reliable in identifying the motor  visual  and language cortex. Language-related rCBF increases were highly distributive  although only part of these activations were subjected to intraoperative stimulation. We conclude that [15O]-water PET can be used for preoperative noninvasive identification of functional cortex and may be useful in neurosurgical preplanning. Intraoperative mapping still remains the main means to avoid neurological damage as it can be performed during the entire surgical procedure to avoid damage to cortex  pathways  and damage secondary to ischemia or edema (brain retraction). ﾂｩ 1997 Forefront Publishing Group   \n",

Edge operators are used to identify tissue interfaces and thereby more realistically model tissue label dependencies between adjacent voxels on opposite sides of an interface. When applied to a synthetic MRI template corrupted by additive noise  it provided more consistent tissue labeling across noise levels than two commonly used methods (FAST and SPM5). When applied to longitudinal MRI series it provided lesser variability in individual trajectories of tissue change  suggesting superior ability to discriminate real tissue change from noise. These results suggest that this method may be useful for robust longitudinal brain tissue change estimation.   \n",

We selected COVID-19 observational studies from eight countries, including, China, Italy, Australia, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19.
